Medical data recognition has been a crucial task in healthcare. Doctors and healthcare professionals have been using various methods to diagnose and treat different medical conditions. However, with the advent of technology, machine learning algorithms have made significant contributions in this field. These algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and detect patterns that are difficult for humans to perceive. As a result, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular for medical data recognition.

The purpose of this extended essay is to compare the precision and performance of two commonly used machine learning algorithms, linear regression and logistic regression, in the recognition of medical conditions based on their symptoms.
