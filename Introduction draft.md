In the field of medical diagnosis, accurately identifying and classifying various conditions is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, have become increasingly popular tools for automating this process. However, the question remains: which of these algorithms is more precise and performs better in the recognition of medical conditions? Our aim is to investigate and compare the precision and performance of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression in the recognition of medical conditions. By analyzing their respective strengths and limitations, this essay aims to determine the extent to which Linear Regression outperforms Logistic Regression in this context.
