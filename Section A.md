## Firewall 
The firewall is a security component placed between the internal network and external access.
### **Purpose** :
- Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- Protects servers and internal devices from unauthorized access.
- Enforces security policies.
### **In this context** :
- Connects and secures communication between:
    - ISP router
    - Core switch
    - Servers
    - Remote switch in the second part of Section A
- Acts as a gateway controlling traffic between internal systems and remote users.
### **Uses** :
- Filters malicious traffic and potential threats.
- Limits access to sensitive resources.
- Provides logging and monitoring of network activities.

## Material
### Core Components:
- **Firewall** – Hardware or software-based (e.g., Fortinet FortiGate, pfSense)
- **Core Switch** – Managed switch with multiple gigabit ports (Cisco Catalyst)
- **ISP Router** – Provided by the internet service provider
- **Remote Switch** – Unmanaged/managed switch to connect remote PCs (Cisco SF110D)
### Servers:
- physical servers  (rack-mounted)
### PCs (Remote Workstations):
- **Recommended Specs:**
    - **CPU:** Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7 with high clock speed (3.5 GHz+)
    - **RAM:** Minimum 16GB
    - **Storage:** SSD (256GB or more)
    - **Network Card:** Gigabit Ethernet
### Cables & Accessories:
- Ethernet cables
- Power supply units & UPS 
- Server rack (if servers are rack-mounted)
- Cable management tools
