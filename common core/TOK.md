I want you to create a structure for my Tok essay based on my prescribed title : "Are we too quick to assume that the most recent evidence is inevitably the strongest? Discuss with reference to the natural sciences and one other area of knowledge." and the two areas of knowledge are natural sciences that was given to us and history. Use the guide "How to Structure a Theory of Knowledge Essay" to create the structure for my Tok essay, make sure for each part of the introduction, body and conclusion to give titles for the paragraphs to explain what should be done in it with brief explanation/review of what is going to be in it. I will also provide you with information, topics, ideas or guiding word that should be included in the essay or will help with it but i dont want you to write the essay just give me A complete and well defined structure for my TOK essay. By the way here is analogy to help better understand what the actual essay aims to tell or be :
The courtroom analogy
It's helpful to think of the TOK essay as though you're sharing the most interesting bits of a conversation between two smart people.  Or you could think about it as presenting two sides of an argument about knowledge, in front of a judge. To be successful each side needs to present evidence and **explain clearly how the evidence relates to the question**. 
One side would say YES to the (prescribed title) question, using evidence and the other is arguing the other side (saying NO), also using evidence.
In your essay, we want to see both sides argued well and then, in your conclusion, you'll weigh up the evidence --telling us which side is the more right (or the ways they're right) and maybe the circumstances wherein the other side would be right.  
**Making sure your evidence actually supports your claims and counterclaims is one of the toughest aspects of the essay.**

Here is the guide "How to Structure a Theory of Knowledge Essay": 
## The TOK Essay Structure

Our structure for the TOK essay has 4 sections (6 paragraphs) overall.

### First, write your introduction. (100-150 words)

### Paragraph 1

-**Say one or two interesting things** about the prescribed title question. This shows us, right away that you know what the question is asking. 

-**Define** one or two of the key terms in the title. Get definitions for all of the main words in your title. You don't need to include all of them in your essay, but it's useful to see how different people think about the words. Sometimes these definitions can also give you some hints for claims, counterclaims or evidence. 

-**Give the reader a roadmap.** Clarify for the reader how you're going to explore the essay question--which AOKs you're using, for example. This will make it easy for the marker to know what to look for.

### Next write your first development. (2 paragraphs totalling 600 words)

### Paragraph 2

-In this paragraph you'll explore your claim for AOK 1. 

-**State your claim**. A claim is a topic sen­tence that outlines your argument about the prescribed title. For example you could claim that, “Mathematics can be relied on because it is a purely logical system. It is axiomatic and independent of subjective experience.”

-**Example**. Your examples can be from your life, like something that you noticed doing your Biology IA, or something from research, like how CRISPR was discovered. The example needs to be specific, precise and real though. And it needs to clar­ify and sup­port the claim. So you could talk about how, “In mathematics we learned that the inside angles of a triangle, in Euclidian space, sum up to 180 degrees.”

-**Explain**. Clarify (and explore) how your example supports your claim. Notice what is interesting about your example and what it says about the title. 

### Paragraph 3

-**Counter-claim.** Argue against your claim above. “However, it is possible to come to different conclusions using different systems of mathematics.”

-**Example**. Provide an example that supports your counter claim. “It is not possible to demonstrate that the interior angles of a triangle equal 180 degrees in Euclidian space, this cannot be proven within other systems, such as spherical geometry or hyperbolic geometry.”

-**Explain**. Clarify (and explore) how your example supports your counterclaim. Notice what is interesting about your example and what it says about the title. 

-**Sum up** the development section. Linking to the prescribed title, highlight the insights you've had about this AOK and the prescribed title. “It is therefore clear that mathematics is reliable to an extent, but often it can only show something to be true within one fixed system or approach.”

### Now, write another two body paragraphs, for your second AOK. (600 words)

### Paragraph 4

-State your **claim**.

-Provide an **example,** which supports the claim.

-Carefully **explain** how the example supports the claim.  

### Paragraph 5

-State your **counter-claim**.

-Provide an **example,** which supports the counter-claim.

-Carefully **explain** how the example supports the counter-claim.  

-**Sum up** the insights you've had about this AOK and the prescribed title.

### Finally, write your conclusion. (200-250 words)

### Paragraph 6

-**Your conclusion**. Explain what insights you've made, related to the prescribed title question. Take some time to synthesize the major insights you had about your two AOKs.  

**Implications and significance**. Also tell us why it's important that we know this. Clarify when and how it's matters that we understand these insights.

-**Perspectives and extensions**. If you can, try to pull in a different perspective, on your conclusion. Perhaps you can recognize a different way of approaching the question, which could have resulted in quite different insights than those you included in your essay. Or you could also mention an unresolved question or a limitation that your exploration revealed.

And finally here is some info that you might want to know:
To explore a knowledge question you need to :
- explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters.
- Clarify the meaning of any keywords or key terms in the essay title. 
- Undercover hidden assumption that are taken for granted.
- Offer a thesis statement that answers the knowledge question.
- Argue your case for your thesis with a clear argument or a coherent sequence of ideas.
- Consider different ways of thinking about the problem.
- Investigate and evaluate different perspectives.
- You need to identify, construct and evaluate both arguments and counter arguments 
- Use specific examples or evidence to make a point or support a discussion
- Asses and evaluate supporting evidence.
- Make relevant connections, explore links and comparisons between areas of knowledge where relevant.
- Apply the 12 Tok concepts and ideas as you see fit.
- Think thew the impaction's of an argument or conclusion and what follows.
