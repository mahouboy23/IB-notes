I also made a structure for my tok essay so i want you to take aspect from both to create a final structure using the st of both the structures.

structure you made
## Introduction

### Paragraph 1

- Briefly state the prescribed title question and define key terms such as "evidence", "recent" and "strongest".
- Provide a roadmap that you will explore this question in the natural sciences and history and discuss whether the most recent evidence is inevitably the strongest in these areas.

## Body Part 1 - Natural Sciences

### Paragraph 2

- Claim: In the natural sciences, the most recent evidence is often assumed to be the strongest because it benefits from advanced technology and new discoveries that build on past research.
- Example: Discuss how modern technology allows for more accurate data collection and analysis in fields like genetics and astronomy compared to the past.
- Explain how this example supports the claim that recent evidence may be viewed as strongest in the natural sciences.

### Paragraph 3

- Counter-claim: However, the most established theories in the natural sciences were once challenged by new evidence that was later proven to be incorrect.
- Example: Discuss Barbara McClintock's challenge to the established theory of genes and how her ideas were initially rejected despite being correct.
- Explain how this example shows that the most recent evidence is not inevitably the strongest in the natural sciences.

### Paragraph 4

- Summarize the insights about whether recent evidence is strongest in the natural sciences based on the examples discussed. Reference could also be made to changing paradigms and theories over time.

## Body Part 2 - History

### Paragraph 5

- Claim: In history, most recent evidence such as newly uncovered artifacts or documents is often viewed as providing the most accurate insights about the past.
- Example: Discuss a specific example like a newly discovered papyrus that provides important historical evidence.
- Explain how this supports the claim that recent evidence seems strongest in history.

### Paragraph 6

- Counter-claim: However, reinterpreting past evidence through different perspectives can challenge existing historical narratives.
- Example: Discuss how historians have reinterpreted events like the fall of the Roman Empire through social or economic lenses rather than military explanations of the past.
- Explain how this challenges the notion that recent evidence is inevitably the strongest in history.

### Paragraph 7

- Summarize insights about whether recent evidence is strongest in history based on examples discussed and how evidence can be reinterpreted.

## Conclusion

### Paragraph 8

- Synthesize the major insights from both areas of knowledge discussed in relation to the prescribed title question. Consider which counter-arguments were most compelling.
- Discuss the implications of when recent evidence should and should not be assumed the strongest based on the discussion. Consider different perspectives and limitations of the arguments.



Structure i made
## Introduction

Paragraph 1:

- Introduce the essay title and note how it raises questions about the relationship between recency of evidence and strength of evidence.
    
- Define key terms like "evidence" and "strongest" evidence.
    
- Provide an overview of the areas of knowledge to be discussed (natural sciences and history) and the approach to be taken in the essay.
    

## Body

Paragraph 2 (Natural Sciences Claim):

- In the natural sciences, there can be a tendency to assume the most recent evidence is the strongest.
    
- Provide an example of when this assumption has proved faulty in the natural sciences.
    
- Explain how the example supports the claim and relate it to the essay title.
    

Paragraph 3 (Natural Sciences Counterclaim):

- However, the most recent evidence in the natural sciences often builds incrementally on prior knowledge.
    
- Provide an example of when the most recent natural science evidence did build on previous evidence.
    
- Explain how the example supports the counterclaim and relate it to the essay title.
    

Paragraph 4 (History Claim):

- In history, new evidence can lead to dramatic shifts in historical interpretations.
    
- Provide an example of new historical evidence leading to revised understandings.
    
- Explain how the example supports the claim and relate it to the essay title.
    

Paragraph 5 (History Counterclaim):

- However, new evidence in history may simply confirm previous historical accounts.
    
- Provide an example of corroborating evidence in history.
    
- Explain how the example supports the counterclaim and relate it to the essay title.
    

## Conclusion

Paragraph 6:

- Synthesize the main insights about the title from the natural sciences and history exploration.
    
- Discuss implications and significance of these insights.
    
- Acknowledge limitations or other perspectives if applicable.
