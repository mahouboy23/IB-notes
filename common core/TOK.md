### **Lesson 2 :** [[personal knowledge]] 

what is history : “History is **an area of knowledge that studies the recorded past**. It raises knowledge questions such as whether it is possible to talk meaningfully about a historical fact and what such a fact might be, or how far we can speak with certainty about anything in the past.

History as an area of knowledge **deals with human actions in time whether by individuals or communities** so it is considered a “human science” for the most part, and the approach to the study of it is a “scientific” one.
