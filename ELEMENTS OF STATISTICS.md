# Introduction to Statistics

## Definition
- **Statistics** =:: collection of methods for planning studies/experiments, obtaining data, organizing, summarizing, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions.
- Goal of statistics =:: collect data from a small part (sample) to learn about the larger group (population).

## Key Terms
- **Data** =:: observations collected (measurements, genders, survey responses).
- **Population** =:: complete collection of all elements studied.
- **Census** =:: data from every member of the population.
- **Sample** =:: subcollection of population members.

### Example
Survey of 1500 U.S. adults → 855 said _yes_ to global warming.
- Population =:: all U.S. adults.
- Sample =:: 1500 surveyed adults.
- Sample data =:: 855 yes, 645 no.

# Parameters vs Statistics

- **Parameter** =:: numerical measurement describing a population characteristic.
- **Statistic** =:: numerical measurement describing a sample characteristic.

**Example 1**: Avg. salary $83,121 from 200 career centers →:: sample statistic.  
**Example 2**: Avg. SAT score 1442 for all 2182 admitted students →:: population parameter.

# Types of Data

## Qualitative vs Quantitative
- **Quantitative data** =:: numbers representing counts/measurements (e.g., weight, population).
- **Qualitative data** =:: attributes, labels, non-numerical (e.g., names, gender).

### Example
Cities & populations:
- Names =:: qualitative.
- Populations =:: quantitative.

## Discrete vs Continuous
- **Discrete data** =:: countable values ($0,1,2,3,\dots$). Example: number of eggs.
- **Continuous data** =:: infinitely many possible values on a scale (e.g., milk amount can be $2.343115$ gallons).

# Graphing Data

## Frequency Distribution
- **Frequency distribution** =:: table showing classes (intervals) with counts of entries.
- Frequency $f$ of class =:: number of entries in class.

### Guidelines to Construct
1. Choose number of classes ($5 \leq \text{classes} \leq 20$).
2. Find class width: $\text{Range}/\text{classes}$, round up.
3. Determine class limits (no overlap).
4. Tally each entry into a class.
5. Count tallies for frequencies.

# Extra Features in Frequency Table

- **Midpoint** =:: $\dfrac{\text{Lower limit} + \text{Upper limit}}{2}$
- **Relative frequency** =:: $\dfrac{f}{n}$ where $n =$ sample size
- **Cumulative frequency** =:: $\sum f$ up to that class
- **Class boundaries** =::
    - Lower boundary = $\text{Lower limit} - 0.5$
    - Upper boundary = $\text{Upper limit} + 0.5$

# Histogram

- **Histogram** =:: bar graph with adjacent bars, showing distribution.
- Horizontal axis =:: class boundaries/midpoints.
- Vertical axis =:: frequencies.

### 5 Key Features (CVDOT)
1. Center =:: typical middle value.
2. Variation =:: spread of data.
3. Distribution =:: shape (bell, skewed, uniform).
4. Outliers =:: unusual far-away values.
5. Time =:: data changes over time.

# Frequency Polygon

- **Frequency polygon** =:: line graph using class midpoints vs frequencies.

# Dotplot

- **Dotplot** =:: each value plotted as a dot; stacked if repeated.

# Stemplot (Stem-and-Leaf Plot)

- Splits each value into:: stem (left digits) + leaf (last digit).
- Similar to histogram but keeps raw data.

# Ogive

- **Ogive** =:: line graph showing cumulative frequencies.
- Horizontal axis =:: upper class boundaries.
- Vertical axis =:: cumulative frequencies.

# Scatter Plot

- **Scatter plot** =:: paired $(x,y)$ data on 2 axes → shows relationship between 2 quantitative variables.
