You work as a Network administrator at Dunis. You have decided to upgrade your computers networks (storage, brand new computers, vendors, memory ect...).
1/ After designing the network topology of the school please describe how did you manage storage
2/ Please propose a clustering system of the storage network
3/ the school internet connectivity is 100mb 50 uploading and 50 downloading you need to connect 300 computers, allowing YouTube and movie download, how would you handle this issue.
4/ In some computers the I/O controller is not responding, why? How would you fix this? What conflicts might exist between the cluster system and the device manager.
