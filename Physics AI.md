**Research Question:** "How does the addition of non-Newtonian fluids affect the damping characteristics of a simple harmonic oscillator?"

### Aim:

The aim of this experiment is to investigate the effect of non-Newtonian fluids (like a cornstarch and water mixture, often referred to as "oobleck") on the damping behavior of a simple harmonic oscillator system. This study will explore an interesting aspect of fluid dynamics and wave mechanics, examining how the unique properties of non-Newtonian fluids influence the oscillatory motion and energy dissipation.

### Méthode:

1. **Setup:** Construct the simple harmonic oscillator (like a pendulum or mass-spring system). Incorporate the non-Newtonian fluid in a way that it interacts with the moving part of the system (e.g., the pendulum bob or mass at the end of the spring).
