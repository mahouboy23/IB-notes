Approaches to non-literary texts 
• The skills of analysing one text type can be transferable to another. It is important not to view these elements in isolation, but to consider how they work together to achieve a specific purpose. The activities will each focus on a specific element, but it is impossible to consider one element without taking into account others; 
• Additionally, we do not want to suggest that you should adopt a linear approach to analysing a text; you may find that tone is the first thing that jumps out at you, or you may be attuned to picking up on o figurative language as you read.
• The purpose « these exercises is to give you the tools to analyse with more confidence.
