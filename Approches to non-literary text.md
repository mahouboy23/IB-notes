## Travel writing techniques
- **First-person narration** : The author/narrator us ab active participant in the experience he or she is sharing, not a passive observer
- **Focus on a key event/experience** : good travel writing is not a catalogue of every detail from the author's journey, but rather a focused account of a specific moment or series of moments with a central message or theme.
- **Appealing to the senses**: travel writers use sensory imagery to immerse the reader in the experience.
- **Use of humour and anecdotes**: travel writers often use humour and quirky anecdotes to engage the audience.
- **A mix of narration and reflection**: a mixture of in-the-moment descriptions and retrospective reflection. Travel writing, especially of the literary kind, often ends with a lesson or message to the reader.
- **Use of descriptive details**: the setting is described in detail so that readers feel as if they are there. In more O literary travel writing, writers also include descriptions of people in the same way that novelists characterize people in their stories. Good travel writers do this with sensitivity, avoiding stereotypes. Travel writing will also include literary elements such as dialogue, metaphor, hyperbole, etc.
