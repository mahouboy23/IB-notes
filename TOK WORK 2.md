## History 

1.  **Do differing historical perspectives promote or hinder knowledge production in history** ?
   I believe that historical perspectives promote knowledge production in history because threw different perspectives we get different views ideas, ideology of different historical events or knowledge and threw that process new knowledge is born from completely different ways of thinking seing things.

   The role of empathy is to put the Historians the on that hold the history knowledge in the position of individuals or groups from another time period with an aim of understanding their thoughts and feelings, and explaining motives that guided their actions within a specific historical context.

4. **Are all the events of the past the subject matter of history?** 
5. **Is historical knowledge predominantly objective or more like a narrative which is agreed on?**
