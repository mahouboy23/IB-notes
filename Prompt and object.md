The prompt "What are the implications of having, or not having, knowledge?". 

Using this prompt, I would choose objects that relate to the idea of the implications of having or not having knowledge. We could discuss how the acquisition of knowledge can lead to personal growth and development, or how the lack of knowledge can lead to fear and uncertainty. 

For my TOK exhibition, I have chosen three objects that I believe are relevant to the prompt "What are the implications of having, or not having, knowledge?"

The first object I have chosen is a book. I believe that books represent knowledge, as they contain information and ideas that can broaden one's understanding of the world. Books can also be interpreted in different ways by different people, and this can lead to further knowledge being created. For example, a reader may come across a new idea or concept while reading a book and then research it further, which leads to the acquisition of new knowledge.

The second object I have chosen is a locked safe. I believe that the locked safe represents the lack of knowledge, as the contents of the safe are unknown until it is opened. This can lead to feelings of uncertainty or even fear, as the unknown can be daunting. In the same way, when we lack knowledge on a certain topic, we may feel unsure or hesitant about making decisions or forming opinions.

The third object I have chosen is a map. I believe that maps represent the acquisition of knowledge, as they provide a visual representation of geographic locations and can help us navigate the world around us. Maps also provide context and can give us a better understanding of the relationships between different places. By using a map, we can gain knowledge about different regions and cultures, and this can lead to a deeper appreciation and understanding of the world.

To answer the questions provided, I could explore the following:

Identify it (What it is. What is its function or purpose?)

-   The book represents knowledge and its function is to convey information and ideas.
-   The locked safe represents the lack of knowledge and its function is to restrict access to information.
-   The map represents the acquisition of knowledge and its function is to provide a visual representation of geographical information.

Contextualize it (Where would you find it? When?)

-   The book could be found in libraries, bookstores, and homes. It has been used as a source of knowledge for centuries.
-   The locked safe could be found in banks, homes, and businesses. It has been used to protect valuable information for centuries.
-   The map could be found in classrooms, libraries, and homes. It has been used to convey geographical knowledge for centuries.

What does it tell or question? (Anything controversial? Something straightforward? Does it raise doubts?)

-   The book could raise questions about the accuracy and reliability of information, the role of the author in shaping knowledge, and the influence of cultural and historical context on the production of knowledge.
-   The locked safe could raise questions about the ethics of restricting access to information, the power dynamics involved in controlling knowledge, and the potential negative consequences of withholding knowledge.
-   The map could raise questions about the limitations of visual representations of knowledge, the biases involved in creating maps, and the cultural and historical context that shapes our understanding of geography.

To whom does it matter? (Who is involved?)

-   The book matters to anyone who seeks knowledge, from students to academics to casual readers.
-   The locked safe matters to anyone who values privacy, security, or the ability to control access to information.
-   The map matters to anyone who is interested in geography, from students to explorers to government officials.
