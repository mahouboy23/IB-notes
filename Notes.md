A common way of thinking about racism is as a view or set of beliefs about the inequality of races, in which some are considered inferior to others. Because this inequality or inferiority is frequently conceived biological-ly,6 it has been argued that this position can be traced to the development of a science of race and to modernity.7 For some, however, racism is rather
a habit of perception that informs and controls the way some people see
some other people,8 and others focus on actions that affect adversely, or
discriminate against, those toward whom they are directed.9 Some add the
condition that racism includes an institutional system of power and in-
equality,10 so that those who lack power, even if they view or act
negatively toward members of a race, are not racist. 11 And others stipulate
the condition that for a view or an action to qualify as racist it needs to be
motivated by ideology.12 Often these emphases are combined in various
ways among themselves and with others,13 presenting an almost chaotic
picture of racism and giving support to those who claim that racism is not
a unified phenomenon.14 Indeed, recently some postmodernists have
adopted a position in which racism is considered to be "whatever it is
claimed to be in discourse," which means that anything anyone says about
racism is acceptable insofar as there is no way to determine whether any
view is better than any other.15 The only point on which there seems to be
wide agreement about racism is in its negative moral quality. 16
