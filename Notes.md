A common way of thinking about racism is as a view or set of beliefs about the inequality of races, in which some are considered inferior to others. Because this inequality or inferiority is frequently conceived biological-ly,6 it has been argued that this position can be traced to the development of a science of race and to modernity.7 For some, however, racism is rather
a habit of perception that informs and controls the way some people see
some other people,8 and others focus on actions that affect adversely, or
discriminate against, those toward whom they are directed.9 Some add the
condition that racism includes an institutional system of power and in-
equality,10 so that those who lack power, even if they view or act
negatively toward members of a race, are not racist. 11 And others stipulate
the condition that for a view or an action to qualify as racist it needs to be
motivated by ideology.12 Often these emphases are combined in various
ways among themselves and with others,13 presenting an almost chaotic
picture of racism and giving support to those who claim that racism is not
a unified phenomenon.14 Indeed, recently some postmodernists have
adopted a position in which racism is considered to be "whatever it is
claimed to be in discourse," which means that anything anyone says about
racism is acceptable insofar as there is no way to determine whether any
view is better than any other.15 The only point on which there seems to be
wide agreement about racism is in its negative moral quality. 16
None of the views mentioned is adequate for our present purposes.
Some are too broad in that they include within racism many phenomena
that are clearly not so. Others are too narrow in that they leave out of the
category phenomena that clearly belong in it. And still others do not
conform to any ordinary understanding of racism or are inadequate for
any attempt at developing a systematic conception of it. Fortunately, it is
not necessary for us to settle the question of the appropriate understand-
ing of racism in order to address the issues that concern us here. For our
purposes, it suffices that we adopt a view of racism that is sufficiently
broad to accommodate the parameters of the controversy we address
without prejudice. I propose the following:
Racism is an attitude toward individual members of a racial group or
toward the racial group as a whole, merely in virtue of the race, and a
racist is someone who has this attitude.
The conception of racism as an attitude is not universally accepted, but
the language employed by many of those who discuss racism leaves room for it insofar as in their discourse they use terms such as hostility, contempt
condescension, and prejudice, which can be interpreted as attitudes. r
Moreover, the broad conception proposed has advantages for the presen
discussion in that it allows for a distinction between self-directed racisn
and other-directed racism and between negative and positive racisms
without ruling any of these out at the outset. It is for these reasons that
adopt it, but note also that most of the arguments that follow do no
depend on this particular conception of racism, nor do I have space
to justify it; my aim in adopting this view is primarily heuristic.
