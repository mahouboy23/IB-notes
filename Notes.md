Other-directed racism is an attitude that people who consider them-
elves to belong to a particular race have concerning certain other people
hat they regard as belonging to a different race precisely because they are
embers of it. Self-directed racism is an attitude that people who consider
hemselves to belong to a particular race have concerning themselves
recisely because they belong to the race. Negative racism consists Of a
egative attitude toward a race or its members, whereas positive racism
onsists of a positive one. Other-directed, self-directed, negative, and
Sitive racisms can be combined. An example of other-directed negative
acism is the attitude toward "Blacks" that was, and still is, common
mong some "Whites" in the United States. It is negative because to be
identified as "Black" carries with it negative connotations and it is other-
irected because it is held by one group of people against another group.
n example of self-directed positive racism is the attitude toward
'Blacks" and being "Black" exemplified by the Black Power Movement
in the sixties. In this case, the emphasis was on "Black" identity and its
ositive aspects. The aim was to develop pride on the part of "Blacks" in
eing "Black" and in those attributes that were thought to be associated
with being "Black." Similar examples can be given of other-directed
ositive racism and self-directed negative racism.

In ordinary discourse the term 'racist' is used to refer to groups,
societies, institutions, and cultures in addition to individual persons, and

it is often reserved for the negative phenomenon.18 A positive attitude
toward members of a racial group, or the racial group itself, held merely
in virtue of racial considerations, on the other hand, is often called racial
pride or kinship, when the attitude belongs to the members of the racial
group in question. 19 There is no name in general use for persons who have
this positive attitude with respect to members of racial groups, or to racial
groups considered as wholes, to which they do not belong, although there
are expressions of this sort for particular racial groups, usually pejorative
and used primarily by those who have a negative racist attitude toward the
group. This has been one of the reasons many object to the use of 'racism'
for any kind of positive racial attitude.20
