The novel "Houseboy" by Cameroonian author Ferdinand Oyono explores the treatment of Toundi, a young African boy, by both French colonizers and his fellow Africans. Toundi is taken in as a servant by a French colonial administrator and soon becomes aware of the injustices and brutality of the French colonial system. At the same time, he is viewed as a traitor by some of his fellow Africans who see him as aligning himself with the oppressors. This dichotomy ultimately impacts Toundi's own sense of identity and belonging.

The French colonizers treat Toundi as a servant, but also as a means to further their own interests. Toundi is initially eager to please his French masters and seeks to assimilate into their culture, but he soon realizes that they view him as inferior and expendable. Toundi is subjected to physical and emotional abuse by the French, and he witnesses firsthand the violent exploitation of his fellow Africans. Despite this mistreatment, Toundi is initially reluctant to challenge his French masters, as he feels indebted to them for providing him with food and shelter.

In contrast, some of Toundi's fellow Africans view him as a traitor and a sell-out for aligning himself with the French colonizers. Toundi is shunned and ridiculed by some of his peers who see him as betraying his African heritage. This rejection by his own community leaves Toundi feeling isolated and confused, as he struggles to reconcile his desire for acceptance with his growing awareness of the injustices of the French colonial system.

One example of the contrasting treatment of Toundi can be seen in the following extract:

"He had become the chief's houseboy, and the villagers looked at him askance. But he did not care. He had other things to think about, like the language he was learning, and the way of life that was gradually becoming his own. He was happy, as only a boy can be happy who has never known anything but the sun on his back and the work of his hands. He was learning fast, and he loved the French for what they were teaching him."

This extract highlights Toundi's enthusiasm for learning and his initial willingness to align himself with the French colonizers. However, it also hints at the growing divide between Toundi and his fellow Africans, who view him with suspicion and disdain.

In terms of the impact on Toundi's own sense of identity and belonging, the contrasting treatment by the French and his fellow Africans leaves him feeling lost and conflicted. Toundi is torn between his desire to assimilate into French culture and his growing awareness of the injustices of the colonial system. At the same time, he feels rejected by his own community and struggles to find a sense of belonging. Ultimately, Toundi's experiences highlight the complex and often conflicting forces at play in the colonial context, and the profound impact these forces can have on individual identity and belonging.

As for a non-literary image that portrays this question, an image of a person standing between two opposing forces, with one hand reaching out to one side and the other hand reaching out to the other side, could represent Toundi's dilemma. The image would depict the conflict and tension that Toundi experiences as he tries to navigate his place in a world that is divided between oppressor and oppressed, and between loyalty to his own culture and the desire to assimilate into the culture of his oppressors.
