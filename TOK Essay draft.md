# TOK essay introduction: 
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the newest is not always the truest," wisely cautioned Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. With these words as our guide, let's embark on a journey that takes us through the realms of the natural sciences and history, as we seek to answer a fundamental question: "Are we too quick to assume that the most recent evidence is inevitably the strongest?"

Imagine this: You're exploring a path where the wisdom of the past meets the exciting discoveries of today. We live in an era where we're constantly bombarded with new information, and it's easy to fall for the appeal of what's brand new. But, as we delve deeper into this topic, we'll start to see that things aren't always as they seem.

Our adventure will lead us through two areas of knowledge: the natural sciences, where we rely on what we see and test, and history, where we look to the past to understand the present. Along the way, we'll uncover the hidden complexities of this idea. We'll peel back the surface to discover the subtle ideas and important consequences that often go unnoticed when we favor the "latest."

Goethe's words encourage us to question the dynamics of evidence in the natural sciences and history. In a world driven by a never-ending quest for what's new, we often assume that 'new' means 'better.' But on our journey through these domains of knowledge, we aim to find out if this assumption holds true. Our goal is to reveal the real power of evidence, going beyond the charm of what's immediate.

Let's dive into the heart of our exploration by addressing a fundamental claim: "Recent evidence is inherently the strongest." This assertion resonates with a common perception - that what's new always carries the most weight. But does this belief hold true when it comes to our pursuit of knowledge?

To tackle this, we'll begin with a critical observation: who exactly are the "we" that tend to place unwavering trust in the most recent evidence? Is it the collective human consciousness, driven by a desire for the latest and the shiniest, or does it extend to certain professionals and experts who work within specialized fields, such as the natural sciences? In essence, the perspective of who "we" are can significantly influence our stance on this matter.
In a world marked by ever-advancing technology, where the information flows in torrents, it's no surprise that the 'new' can seem irresistible. The question arises: does our sense of being swayed by what's recent merely stem from a fascination with novelty, or does it have deeper roots in our society's relentless march towards progress?

The distinction between professional and unprofessional handling of evidence also plays a crucial role in this debate. Do experts in their respective fields handle recent evidence differently than the general population? Are they more discerning, employing rigorous methods to evaluate the strength of recent evidence, or are they just as susceptible to the allure of what's new?

Additionally, we must consider how we come to know something. Is our trust in recent evidence grounded in solid reasoning and logical thinking? Do we rely on numerical data that quantifies the newness, or are we drawn to the physical manifestations of innovation? The production of knowledge, in both the natural sciences and history, often hinges on these very questions, prompting us to delve deeper into the mechanisms by which we assess the strength of evidence.
