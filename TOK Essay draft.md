# Introduction

In exploring whether recent evidence invariably holds superior strength, it is pivotal to clarify the essence of "evidence" and "strongest" within this discourse. "Evidence" encompasses more than raw data; it represents information substantiating or challenging established beliefs. "Strongest" does not merely connote recency but encapsulates robustness and reliability within a given context.
Moreover, shedding light on the natural sciences and history serves as a foundational step. The natural sciences, rooted in experimentation, consistently redefine paradigms with fresh evidence. Conversely, history navigates the fragmented remnants of the past, subject to perpetual reinterpretation amidst evolving perspectives.
This essay aims to uncover the intricate relationship between recency and evidential strength, transcending the allure of immediate information. By exploring these distinct areas of knowledge, it endeavor's to discern whether the tendency to prioritize recent findings overshadows the enduring validity of established understandings. It strives to strike a balance between embracing innovation and honoring the enduring wisdom embedded in historical knowledge.
# Body (natural sciences *work in progress*)
When considering whether we are too quick to assume the most recent evidence is vital, it is essential to consider different perspectives on who precisely "we" refers to. Does it mean humanity collectively, driven by the novelty and flash of recent discoveries in a world of constant technological advancement? Or does it specifically apply to those working within knowledge-producing fields like the natural sciences?
For experts in areas reliant on gathering empirical evidence, such as genetics, new techniques undoubtedly aid the derivation of recent solid data in potent ways. The past few decades have seen revolutionary tools that have transformed scientific inquiry, from sequencing the first genomes to editing DNA with precision. Technologies like whole genome sequencing now allow the collection and analysis of vast troves of genetic information from huge populations with minimal effort. Researchers leverage these powerful methods to derive compelling links between inheritance patterns and illnesses. Findings derived from enormous recent datasets using CRISPR and other cutting-edge methods suggest the firmest understanding yet of how our traits and predispositions arise.

The immense scale and sophistication of genetics research today were only possible with technological progress. When considering genetics as a case study, it is understandable why evidence generated through state-of-the-art means may appear overwhelmingly definitive. In fields like genetics, techniques enabling the collection of massive datasets and rigorous testing of hypotheses lend strong support for theories based on recent evidence. As technology continuously improves methods for examining the natural world, findings derived using cutting-edge means become seen as definitive within specialized communities. Over time, accepted understandings drawn from landmark initial investigations are built upon further by successive works applying newly available techniques.

This process incrementally reinforces confidence in theories as multiple independent studies bolster early conclusions. Practitioners trust findings enabled through reliable experimentation more than notions lacking robust validation. While openness to revision remains key, natural scientists perceive knowledge affirmed with extensive backing from repetitive experiments under varying conditions as surer than theories unsupported or contradicted by available evidence. Therefore, within domains continuously refining empirical investigation, the latest understandings enjoy a strong reputation when meeting standards of replicable, quantifiable proof applied consistently through successive works.

While recent evidence enabled by innovative techniques understandably assumes repute within specialized fields, this affinity risks sidelining valuable insights arising through more humble means. As genetics itself shows, revolutionary thinking sometimes emerges independently of prevailing technological winds. In the 1940s and 50s, Barbara McClintock conducted pioneering work on corn that contradicted acceptance views of the time despite employing only basic observation. Through diligent study without modern aids, she uncovered mobile genetic elements in chromosomes, revealing a layer of complexity eluding others.

However, McClintock's revelation of "jumping genes" faced scepticism from those wedded more rigidly to existing precepts than open inquiry. Her evidence contravened entrenched stances yet has since withstood the test of time. While initially dismissed, later corroborating experiments established her watershed idea as visionary rather than wrong. This example cautions the natural sciences against too swiftly relegating past understandings on the grounds of perceived inadequacy alone.

Even rudimentary evidence thoughtfully marshalled through painstaking investigation holds the potential to reshape prevailing narratives if impartially evaluated on merit rather than a bias toward novelty. As was shown, theoretical revolutions sometimes originate from the very lack of complication defining earlier eras yet allow problems previously invisible to emerge. This suggests that modern evidence, however robust, only sometimes surpasses all predecessors in reliability or significance. Discoveries of every age may augment collective knowledge when vetted rigorously rather than being preemptively discredited.

# Body (History *Not finished*)
Historical research relies on understanding the past through available evidence like artefacts, documents and accounts. This fact allows narratives of bygone eras to be reconstructed. In this section, I will discuss whether recent discoveries provide the most vital insights in history or if reinterpreting older evidence can also challenge established views.

For my first point, I argue that in history, recent evidence uncovered Through archaeological excavations or archives can offer compelling perspectives. As an example, the recent discovery of Annius Domesticus' previously unknown manuscripts from Ancient Rome has provided invaluable eyewitness accounts of specific eras. Found in 2020, these manuscripts, dated to around 80 CE, include detailed descriptions of gladiatorial contests, imperial court life, and military campaigns absent from other sources. Access to this newly found primary evidence has allowed historians to strengthen their understanding of political, social and cultural aspects of the late Roman Republic in ways not possible before. The level of direct observation and unfiltered context these new materials provide can make the primary source accounts they contain challenging to dismiss.

However, for my counterargument, reinvestigating older evidence through alternative frameworks can also pose interpretative challenges. For instance, the view of the fall of the Western Roman Empire has faced reevaluation. Where historians once primarily attributed the collapse to invading forces, modern interdisciplinary lenses have reconsidered other social, economic and environmental factors. Byzantine records from after the 5th century CE, along with studies such as paleoclimate research, have allowed problematic assumptions to be re-examined. This example shows we can only sometimes take the earliest perspectives as definitive, as older sources subjected to innovative scrutiny may stimulate new, credible conclusions just as contemporary discoveries do.
