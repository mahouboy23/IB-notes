## Paragraph 
If I were president of Senegal, my top priority would be changing and improving the healthcare system to ensure accessible, high-quality care for all Senegalese especially those in rural and deprived zones. First of all we should increase the reach of healthcare facilities in rural areas by building new clinics and upgrading existing ones. This can ensure that people in remote areas have easier access to essential services like primary care, maternal health, and vaccination programs. Secondly we should Invest in training more healthcare professionals like doctors and nurses, but also offer programs that encourage those healthcare providers to work in rural areas. Lastly we put more of a focus on educating the populace through digital awareness and educational programs. In this way, improving healthcare access, workforce training, and digital education can lead to a healthier and more aware Senegal. It is time to lock in the best prices on phone should be available at anytime. Actually need to learn and now what i actually need to do and what my homework is ??? Also there is no introduction to business class homework. Also what is he waffle ling about now... But moving on i still think we need to study the importance of capital gains tax or???
