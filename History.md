## A pluralistic approach 
There is, of course, no easy way for us to gain certain knowledge of the past, nor escape from our own prejudices and achieve a God's-eye-view of history. Since history has often been used to promote the interest of dominant nation. Dominant nation and powerful elites, it is not surprising that some people are suspicious of the official version of the truth. In a multicultural world one might argue that textbooks should reflect the experiences of elites but also of groups such as women and ethnic minorities indeed, rather than thinking of history in the singular, it might be better to think in terms of history we have to explore the past from a variety of perspectives 

There are many reason for pursuing historical knowledge. We can justify history on various grounds, including that it gives us a share memory and enriching our understanding of human nature, is a defence against propaganda and can provide a range of perspective.


## History gives
History gives us a shared memory. You can know a person if you know something about his history, you can also know a country if you know something about its history and collective national memories. If you are to have informed opinions about current affairs, and your judgements about other countries are to go beyond mere prejudice, then a knowledge of history is indispensable. Education system will take a peculiar approach to the teaching of history. For example a school history textbook might shape a student's sense of identity, and a collective national memory. Textbooks written about the same historical person or event may take approaches. 
The key issue is who interprets the collective national memory for today, and how it's represented, This issues have significant implications for knowledge and knowing.
