The challenge that i faced was the passing of my mother that was very sudden we started seing her behave differently and she was not in a right state of mind and also said nonsensical words (during that time my father was in a business trip and came a bit before she was administered in a hospital). she then suddenly fell really ill and died a few days latter. for we needed to go to my home country to bury her and do the funeral and it was probably the hardest time for Mr as i tough stuff like this only happen and can't happen to me. The trip for the funeral happened during the winter vacation but i still a week or two of school. This really impacted my first trimester as did not finish well and the start of the second did not go any better i barely passed the first mock exam for the brevet a 9th grade exam. But thanks to the support of my father who did a really good gesture where before with my mother and the whole family we often went went to restaurant to eat out after church and since her death he religiously did this every Sunday as it became a tradition. But also with the help of the school's and my friends, as well as my tutor i managed to improve trimester by trimester and i managed to pass my exam
