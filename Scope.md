## History: 
For the area of Knowledge history we could ask the following question : what is being studied, and what kind of problems can be solved ? What are the limitation ? What are some of the current open, unanswered or contentious question ? Are all ares of knowledge concerned with knowledge of the past to some extent ? 

**Introduction**
It is important to understand the past in order to appreciate our place and context now, in time and space. 

*What is history:* Why do we pursue knowledge and understanding of the past ? 
To answer the question what is history we might begin by saying it is the study of the past. However the answer is more complicated than that. History wants focused almost exclusively
on telling the story of Kings and Queens, Great leaders, Military campaigns, Wars and Politics. Moreover there has been a significant shift in focus regarding the topics, scope and modern technologie. 
Where as some historians might specialized in a specified time period such as the 1500s. In addition, history does not exist in a discipline in isolation. Historian might collaborate with experts from other ares of knowledge, and borrow form the methodologies of other disciplines in other to develop related subject areas, such as art History, economic history or archeology

- HOW CAN WE KNOW ABOUT THE PAST : 
People know what happened in the past by **looking at things from the past including sources (like books, newspapers, and letters) and artifacts (like pottery, tools, and human or animal remains.)** Libraries, archives, and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history. 
- 
- HOW CAN WE CONSTRUCT KNOWLEDGE AS PART OF A STUDY OF HISTORY : 
Language plays a substantial role in the recording of history and passing on of collective memory. Some knowledge communities draw on oral history, whereas others record data in writing or symbols. Much historical knowledge has been passed on **through language via textbooks**.
