# Summary Notes: Starting and Growing a Startup

#### 1. **Starting with Vision and Incorporation**

- Begins with a vision for a unique product or service.
- Early stages involve fun tasks (logos, concepts) and serious steps like legal structuring.
- Incorporating a company in the US costs between $25 and several thousand dollars (fees + legal).
- Early funding often comes from **family, friends, or crowdfunding**.
- Initial shares allocation: e.g., 100,000 shares issued, split among founders and investors.  
    Example: A family friend invests $50,000 for 20% equity (valuing the company at $250,000).

#### 2. **Seed Investment**

- Early funding round is called a **seed round**.
- Investors provide money in exchange for equity (ownership).
- Example: 40% shares for each founder, 20% for the investor.

#### 3. **Growth and Series A Funding**

- After initial success (e.g., beta trials), startups need larger funding (**Series A**).
- Sources: **Angel Investors** (individuals) or **Venture Capitalists (VCs)** (firms).
- Negotiating valuations:
    - **Pre-money valuation**: Current value before investment.
    - **Post-money valuation**: Pre-money valuation + investment amount.
- Example: $1 million investment for 12.5% stake (post-money valuation = $8M).

#### 4. **Equity Dilution**

- New investments dilute existing owners’ shares (their percentage decreases).
    - Example: Founders and early investors' 100% stake becomes 75% after Series A.
- Dilution is proportional but doesn’t reduce the actual number of shares owned.

#### 5. **Subsequent Rounds and Valuations**

- Further rounds (Series B, C, etc.) bring more investment at increasing valuations.
- Stock splits may occur, increasing the number of shares everyone holds proportionally.

#### 6. **Exit Strategies**

- **Acquisition**: Selling the company to a larger entity.
    - Founders often stay with the company (vesting agreements).
- **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**:
    - Company issues shares to the public via the stock market.
    - Example: Shares start at $64 and rise to $70+ on the first day.

#### 7. **Outcomes**

- IPO or acquisition creates wealth for founders and investors.
- Founders often remain involved, continuing to grow the business despite "exit."

#### Key Concepts:

- **Seed Investment**: Early funding for initial growth.
- **Dilution**: Reduction in ownership percentage as new shares are issued.
- **IPO**: Selling shares to the public, turning equity into liquid assets.
