## 🧭 Principles of Management

### Henri Fayol’s 14 Principles

Evolution-of-Management-Thought…

1. Division of Work → specialization = efficiency
    
2. Authority & Responsibility → managers must be accountable
    
3. Discipline → respect rules
    
4. Unity of Command → one boss per worker
    
5. Unity of Direction → one plan, one leader per goal
    
6. Subordination of Individual Interest → company > personal interests
    
7. Remuneration → fair pay motivates workers
    
8. Centralization → degree of decision-making at top
    
9. Scalar Chain → clear chain of command
    
10. Order → proper arrangement of people & resources
    
11. Equity → fairness and kindness
    
12. Stability of Tenure → low turnover = efficiency

## 🏛️ Evolution of Management Thought

### Early Foundations

Evolution-of-Management-Thought…

- Ancient Egypt, China, Mesopotamia → admin systems for building, governing, trade.
    

### Classical Approaches

- **Henri Fayol** – 14 principles, structure, efficiency, universal application.
    
- **Frederick Taylor** – _Scientific Management_ (time & motion studies, “one best way”).
    
    - Pros: efficiency, productivity.
        
    - Cons: ignored human needs, too mechanical.
        

### Human Relations Movement

- Emphasized motivation, communication, employee well-being.
    

### Modern Approaches (1990s onward)

- **TQM (Total Quality Management)** → continuous improvement, customer focus.
    
- **Knowledge Management** → knowledge as key asset (Microsoft, IBM).
    
- **BPR (Business Process Reengineering)** → redesign for efficiency (IBM restructuring).
    
- **Globalization** → expansion across countries (MTN, Dangote).
    
- **Technology/Digitalization** → e-commerce, ERP systems (Amazon).
    

### Today’s Management Challenges

- Blend efficiency with **human-centered** approaches.
    
- Emphasize adaptability, continuous learning, and employee well-being.

Perfect ✅ I’ll adapt the notes into **Obsidian-style spaced repetition cards** using the `::` and `?` syntax so your plugin can recognize them. I’ll keep the structure clear (topics + cloze-style Q&A) while still being revision-friendly.

Here’s the updated version:
