Making Intuitive Decisions
Definition
Intuitive decision making relies on gut feeling, instincts, and
personal experience, often made quickly without detailed
analysis.

Making Creative Decisions
Definition
Creative decision making involves innovative thinking to
generate solutions that are new, unique, and outside
conventional approaches.

Making Rational Decisions
Definition

Rational decision making is a systematic, step-by-step approach to selecting the best option based on facts and logical
reasoning.

Programmed Decisions:
Routine, repetitive, often automated using rules and policies.
Example: Reordering raw materials once inventory drops
below a threshold.

Non-Programmed Decisions:
Unstructured, novel, requiring unique solutions.
Example: Deciding whether to merge with another company.


# Case Study: 

## Decision Making in African Companies – Interswitch (Nigeria) & Sonatel/Orange Senegal

1. Interswitch (Nigeria):  
- Was the decision to launch Quickteller more creative or rational? Why?  
- What risks could Interswitch have faced if Nigerians were slow to adopt digital payments?  

a) I believe the decision to Launch Quickteller was more of a creative decision than a rational one. This is because, if you look at the problem that sparked the creation of Quickteller, they had millions of Nigerian who were unbanked and was turning to a growing mobile market to satisfy there needs. They only had a few options either stay in their current market or innovate and create a consumer brand to expand digital payments to individuals and small businesses. (continue)

b).The risks that Interswitch could have faced if Nigerians were slow to adopt digital payments are that . (continue)


1. Sonatel/Orange (Senegal):  

- Was investing heavily in 4G a risky or safe rational decision?  
- Could an intuitive approach (based only on gut feeling of demand growth) have worked as well?  

a) Investing heavily in 4G was a risky rational decision because first of all it falls into the Strategic Decisions (Top Management) which long term decision with high risk. Other contributing factors are the high cost of implementation, customers had limited income so risk of adopting the new technology. (continue)

b) I do not beliebe and intuitive approach would have worked as well because it depends on each individual how good there sense and intuition are. Analysing the situation and taking in all relevant information and data gives out a more informed decision. (continue)


1. General Application:  

- Compare Interswitch’s and Sonatel’s approaches. Which decision-making style (creative vs. rational) do you think is more important for African companies in today’s digital economy?      
- If you were a manager at a Senegalese or Nigerian startup, would you rely more on rational, intuitive, or creative decision making? Explain.

a)  (continue)
b) I would rely more on creative decision making because especially for start up being creative and innovative is especially important to break into the market and get your product adopted. Also as a start up you don't have all the necessary ressources to gather all the data and go into deep analysis. (continue)
