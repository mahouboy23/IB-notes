# Chapter 1: The Economic Problem
## Core Idea
- **Scarcity**: Limited resources, unlimited wants → central problem in economics.  
- **Economics** studies how societies allocate scarce resources to produce goods/services, meet needs, and distribute them.  
- Key concepts: *Scarcity, Choice, Efficiency, Well-being, Equity, Sustainability, Change, Interdependence, Intervention*.
- **Economy** is the combination of all productive activity within the same area

---

## Factors of Production
- **Land**: Natural resources (minerals, oil, forests, water).  
- **Labour**: Human effort (physical & mental).  
- **Capital**: Man-made resources (machinery, tools, factories).  
- **Entrepreneurship**: Risk-taking, innovation, combining factors to create goods/services.

---

## Opportunity Cost
- **Definition**: Value of the next best alternative forgone.  
- Every choice involves a trade-off.  
- Example: Choosing dinner over a movie → opportunity cost = movie.  
- **Economic goods**: Produced with scarce resources → involve opportunity cost.  
- **Free goods**: Abundant, no opportunity cost (e.g., sunlight, air).

---

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC/PPF)
- Shows **maximum combinations of two goods** an economy can produce using available resources & technology.  
- **On the curve** = Productive efficiency (all resources fully used).  
- **Inside the curve** = Inefficiency (resources underused).  
- **Outside the curve** = Unattainable with current resources.  
- **Shift outward** = Economic growth (more resources/tech progress).

## Three Basic Economic Questions
1. **What to produce?**  
   → Which goods/services should be made.  
2. **How to produce?**  
   → What combination of factors/techniques to use.  
3. **For whom to produce?**  
   → How output is distributed among individuals/groups.

---

## Economic Systems
- **Free Market**: Allocation mainly by supply & demand, minimal state intervention.  
- **Planned Economy**: Government decides what/how/for whom.  
- **Mixed Economy**: Blend of both. Most real-world economies fall here.  

---

# Chapter 2: Demand, Supply & Elasticity
## Demand
- **Definition**: Quantity of a good consumers are willing & able to buy at a given price in a time period.  
- **Law of Demand**:  
  $$P \downarrow \;\Rightarrow\; Q_d \uparrow \quad \text{and vice versa}$$  
- **Demand function**:  
  $$Q = f(P)$$  

### Determinants of Demand
- Own price of the good.  
- Income of consumers.  
- Price of related goods:  
  - **Complements**: consumed together (car & petrol).  
  - **Substitutes**: alternatives (Coke & Pepsi).  
- Tastes/preferences.  
- Expectations of future prices.  
- Advertising.  
- Distribution of income.

### Types of Goods
- **Normal goods**: Demand ↑ when income ↑.  
- **Inferior goods**: Demand ↓ when income ↑.  

### Changes in Demand
- **Movement along curve** = price change.  
- **Shift of curve** = non-price determinant change (income, substitutes, etc.).  

---

## Supply
- **Definition**: Quantity producers are willing & able to sell at a given price in a time period.  
- **Law of Supply**:  
  $$P \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; Q_s \uparrow$$  

### Determinants of Supply
- Price.  
- Cost of production.  
- Technology.  
- Prices of related outputs.  
- Government policy.

### Changes in Supply
- **Movement along curve** = price change.  
- **Shift of curve** = change in costs, tech, policy, etc.

---

## Market Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium price (P\*)**: Where $Q_d = Q_s$.  
- Below P\*: shortage (excess demand).  
- Above P\*: surplus (excess supply).  
- **Market forces** push price toward equilibrium.

### Government Intervention
- **Price ceiling**: Max legal price (e.g., rent control).  
- **Price floor**: Min legal price (e.g., minimum wage).  

---

## Elasticity
### Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)
- **Definition**: Responsiveness of quantity demanded to price change.  
$$E_d = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}$$  

- **Types**:  
  - Elastic: $E_d > 1$  
  - Inelastic: $E_d < 1$  
  - Unitary: $E_d = 1$  
  - Perfectly elastic: $E_d = \infty$  
  - Perfectly inelastic: $E_d = 0$

- **Determinants**:  
  - Availability of substitutes.  
  - Proportion of income spent.  
  - Necessity vs luxury.  
  - Time horizon.

- **Elasticity & Revenue**:  
  - Elastic demand: $P \uparrow \Rightarrow TR \downarrow$  
  - Inelastic demand: $P \uparrow \Rightarrow TR \uparrow$  

### Income Elasticity of Demand
$$E_y = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta Y}$$  
- $E_y > 0$ → Normal good.  
- $E_y < 0$ → Inferior good.  
- $E_y > 1$ → Luxury good.  
- $0 < E_y < 1$ → Necessity.

### Cross-Price Elasticity
- Responsiveness of demand for one good to price change of another.  
- Complements: Negative.  
- Substitutes: Positive.

### Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)
$$E_s = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_s}{\%\Delta P}$$  
- Elastic if $E_s > 1$, inelastic if $E_s < 1$.  
- Depends on production flexibility, spare capacity, and time period.

# Chapter 3: Efficiency & Equity
## Efficiency
- **Definition**: How well resources are used to maximize output & welfare.  
- **Static efficiency**: At a point in time.  
  - **Allocative efficiency**: $P = MC$ → resources match consumer preferences.  
  - **Productive efficiency**: Output at minimum average cost (AC).  

### Pareto Efficiency
- A state where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.

### PPF & Efficiency
- Points **on** PPF: Productive + Allocative efficiency.  
- Cannot increase production of one good without reducing another.

### Dynamic Efficiency
- Long-run improvements in efficiency via innovation, investment, and technology → economic growth.

---

## Equity
- **Equity**: Fairness in the distribution of resources.  
- Different from efficiency:  
  - Efficiency = maximizing the size of the “pie”.  
  - Equity = how the pie is divided.  

---

## Trade-Offs Between Efficiency & Equity
- Market equilibrium may be efficient but not equitable.  
- Example: A society may achieve efficiency but with unfair income distribution.  

# Chapter 4: Government in the Market
## Core Idea
- **Government intervention**: Regulatory actions taken by the state to affect or interfere with decisions made by individuals, groups, or firms regarding social and economic matters.  
- Markets alone do not always achieve socially optimal outcomes → government intervenes to correct **market failures** and promote **equity**.

---

## Reasons for Government Intervention
1. **Information**  
   - Markets may fail when buyers/sellers lack adequate information.  
   - Examples of government policies to improve information flows:  
     - Public education and extension services.  
     - Government-supported media & information delivery.  
     - Labeling requirements.  
     - Truth-in-advertising laws.  

2. **Externalities**  
   - **Definition**: Spillover costs/benefits of production or consumption that affect third parties without compensation.  
   - **Types of externalities**:  
     - **Negative externalities** (costs to society, e.g., pollution).  
     - **Positive externalities** (benefits to society, e.g., vaccination).  
     - **Production externalities** (arise during production process).  
     - **Consumption externalities** (arise during consumption).  

   - **Negative Externality Graph** 
     ![[image-20230203083115173 1.png]]
	 - MPC = Marginal Private Cost.  
     - MSC = Marginal Social Cost.  
     - Market overproduces (Q₁ > Q\*).  
     - Welfare loss created.  

   - **Positive Externality Graph** 
     ![[image-20230208084954664.png]]
     - MPB = Marginal Private Benefit.  
     - MSB = Marginal Social Benefit.  
     - Market underproduces (Q₁ < Q\*).  
     - Potential welfare gain if corrected.  

3. **Public Goods**  
   - Characteristics:  
     - **Non-rivalrous**: One person’s use does not reduce availability to others.  
     - **Non-excludable**: Cannot prevent non-payers from consuming.  
   - Examples: national security, public infrastructure, clean air, public research.  
   - Problem: **Free rider issue** → markets underprovide.  

4. **Noncompetitive Behavior**  
   - Markets sometimes dominated by a few or a single producer.  
   - Examples: monopoly, cartels, oligopoly.  
   - Issues: reduced output, higher prices, inefficiency.  
   - Government response:  
     - **Antitrust legislation**.  
     - Regulation of natural monopolies.  

5. **Distribution of Income & Wealth**  
   - Markets often result in unequal distribution.  
   - Governments use transfer policies to promote equity:  
     - Income & inheritance taxes.  
     - Social security systems.  
     - Welfare programs, healthcare, and education subsidies.  

---

## Tools of Government Intervention
1. **Taxes**  
   - Imposed on goods/services to:  
     - Correct negative externalities (internalize external costs).  
     - Raise revenue for public expenditure.  
   - **Graph: Tax correcting externality**   
     - Optimum tax = MSC – MC.  
     ![[image-20230207165457620 1.png]]

2. **Subsidies**  
   - Financial aid provided to encourage production/consumption of goods with positive externalities.  
   - Examples: education, healthcare, renewable energy.  
   - **Graph: Subsidy correcting externality**  
     - Optimum subsidy = MC – MSC.  
     ![[image-20230207165514044.png]]

# Chapter 5: Production, Cost & Output
## Production Process
- **Production**: Process of combining inputs (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship, and knowledge) to produce goods or services with value.  
- It creates **utility** — goods and services that satisfy human wants.

---

## Sectors of the Economy
- **Primary Sector**: Extraction of natural resources (agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining).  
- **Secondary Sector**: Manufacturing and processing industries that transform raw materials into finished products.  
- **Tertiary Sector**: Services such as tourism, health, media, education, and IT.  

**Economic Development Pattern:**  
- In **LDCs**: Primary > Secondary > Tertiary  
- In **DCs**: Tertiary > Secondary > Primary  

---

## Time Periods in Production
- **Momentary Period**: No factors can be changed; supply is perfectly inelastic.  
- **Short Run**: At least one factor is fixed (usually capital). Labor is variable.  
- **Long Run**: All factors are variable but technology remains fixed.  
- **Very Long Run**: All factors and technology can change (innovation and R&D).

---

## Labor vs Capital Intensive Production
- **Labor-Intensive Production**: Uses a larger proportion of labor (e.g., teaching, film-making).  
- **Capital-Intensive Production**: Uses a larger proportion of machinery/equipment (e.g., car manufacturing).  

**Choice depends on:**  
- Availability and cost of labor and capital.  
- Nature of product and technology used.  
- Scale of production.

---

## Production & Productivity
- **Production**: Total output produced.  
- **Productivity**: Efficiency of converting inputs into outputs.  

### Formulas
- **Labor Productivity** = Total Output ÷ Number of Workers  
- **Capital Productivity** = Total Output ÷ Capital Employed  

### Ways to Improve Productivity
- Training and specialization.  
- Advanced technology and innovation.  
- Better management and motivation.  

### Advantages of High Productivity
- Lower unit costs.  
- Higher profits and competitiveness.  
- Improved living standards.

---

## Costs of Production
- **Costs**: Total expenses in the production process (wages, rent, materials, etc.).

### Types of Costs
- **Fixed Costs (FC)**: Do not vary with output (e.g., rent, salaries).  
   ![[file-20251025095634051.png]]

- **Variable Costs (VC)**: Vary with output (e.g., wages, raw materials).  
   ![[file-20251025095735101.png]]  

- **Total Cost (TC)**: Sum of all fixed and variable costs.  
  $$TC = FC + VC$$  
  ![[file-20251025095911401.png]] 

- **Average Cost (AC)**: Cost per unit of output.  
  $$AC = \dfrac{TC}{Q}$$  
  ![[file-20251025100049665.png]]  

- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**:  
  $$AFC = \dfrac{FC}{Q}$$  
   ![[file-20251025100207037.png]] 

---

## Revenues
- **Total Revenue (TR)**:  
  $$TR = P \times Q$$  
   ![[file-20251025100247537.png]] 

- **Average Revenue (AR)**:  
  $$AR = \dfrac{TR}{Q}$$  

- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:  
  $$MR = \dfrac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$$  

---

## Profit and Break-Even
- **Profit** = TR − TC  
- **Break-Even Point**: Where TR = TC → no profit, no loss.  
- **If** TR > TC → profit.  
- **If** TR < TC → loss.  
 ![[file-20251025100409642.png]]  

---

## Business Objectives
- **Corporate objectives**: Set by top management to define overall business direction.  
- Examples: Profit maximization, growth, sustainability, market share, innovation.  

---

# Chapter 6: Perfect Competition
## Definition
- **Perfect competition**: A market structure where many small firms sell identical products and none can influence market price.  
- Firms are **price takers** — they accept the market-determined price.

---

## Conditions for Perfect Competition
1. Homogeneous (identical) products.  
2. Many buyers and sellers (each too small to affect price).  
3. Free entry and exit — no barriers.  
4. Perfect knowledge of prices and products.  

![[file-20251025100546450.png]]

---

## Firm Behavior in Perfect Competition
- Objective: **Profit maximization**.  
  $$\text{Profit} = TR - TC$$  
- **Total Revenue (TR)** = P × Q  
- **Marginal Revenue (MR)** = change in TR from one more unit sold.  
- In perfect competition, **P = MR = AR**.

---

## Firm’s Output Decision
### 1. Using TR and TC Curves
- At low output → losses (TR < TC).  
- At mid output → maximum profit.  
- At high output → losses again due to rising costs.  
![[file-20251025100718295.png]]

### 2. Marginal Analysis
- Profit is maximized when:  
  $$MR = MC$$  
  or equivalently,  
  $$P = MC$$  
![[file-20251025100755540.png]]

---

## The Shut-Down Rule
- **Rule**:  
  - Continue producing if **P ≥ AVC**.  
  - Shut down if **P < AVC** (can’t cover variable costs).  
![[file-20251025100836797.png]]

- **Shutdown Point**: The firm is indifferent between producing and closing; loss = TFC.  

---

## The Firm’s Supply Curve
- In the short run, a firm’s **supply curve** is its **MC curve above the minimum AVC**.  
(("Firm’s Short-Run Supply Curve — MC above AVC forms the supply line"))

---

## Market Supply & Short-Run Equilibrium
- Market supply = total output supplied by all firms.  
- **Short-run equilibrium**: occurs where **market demand = market supply**.  
(("Short-Run Market Equilibrium — industry and firm diagrams side by side"))

---

## Short-Run Profits or Losses
- **Profit:** P > ATC → supernormal profit.  
- **Break-even:** P = ATC → normal profit (zero economic profit).  
- **Loss:** P < ATC → economic loss, but may still operate if P ≥ AVC.  
(("Firm’s Profit and Loss Areas — shaded regions on cost/revenue diagram"))

---

## Long-Run Equilibrium
- Firms enter if profits exist; exit if losses occur.  
- Entry → more supply → lower price.  
- Exit → less supply → higher price.  
- Long-run equilibrium: **P = MC = ATC** → normal profit.  
(("Long-Run Adjustment through Entry and Exit — supply shifts restoring normal profit"))

---

## Efficiency in Perfect Competition
- In long-run equilibrium:  
  - **Allocative efficiency**: P = MC (resources optimally allocated).  
  - **Productive efficiency**: production at minimum ATC (lowest possible cost).  
(("Efficiency under Perfect Competition — equilibrium at minimum ATC and P = MC"))

---

## Summary
- Perfect competition: many firms, identical products, free entry/exit, perfect info.  
- Profit maximization at **MR = MC**.  
- Short-run: profits or losses possible.  
- Long-run: only normal profit remains; efficiency achieved.
