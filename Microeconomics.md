## **Question 1** â€” Scarcity, Choice and the PPC
(a) Define scarcity and opportunity cost. Explain the main assumptions of the production
possibilities curve (PPC/PPF) and draw a clearly labelled PPC showing efficient, inefficient, and
unattainable points. (10)



(b) Using your diagram, analyse how an increase in the quality/quantity of factors of production
affects potential output (outward shift) versus how cyclical unemployment appears (movement
inside the curve). Apply to a real context. (10)
(c) Evaluate the view that outward shifts of the PPC are always desirable. (10)
