## **Question** 2 — Market Equilibrium, Surplus and Shortage
(a) Define market equilibrium, excess demand (shortage), and excess supply (surplus). Draw a
fully-labelled D–S diagram identifying equilibrium P*, Q* and the directions of price pressure
when price is above/below equilibrium. (10)



(b) A normal good experiences a rise in consumer income. Use a diagram to analyse how
demand, equilibrium price and quantity change. Apply to a market you know. (10)



(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of a maximum price (price ceiling) to address affordability
problems (e.g., urban rents). Discuss shortages, and alternative policies. (10)


## **Question 1** — Scarcity, Choice and the PPC
(a) Define scarcity and opportunity cost. Explain the main assumptions of the production
possibilities curve (PPC/PPF) and draw a clearly labelled PPC showing efficient, inefficient, and
unattainable points. (10)



(b) Using your diagram, analyse how an increase in the quality/quantity of factors of production
affects potential output (outward shift) versus how cyclical unemployment appears (movement
inside the curve). Apply to a real context. (10)



(c) Evaluate the view that outward shifts of the PPC are always desirable. (10)
