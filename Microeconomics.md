# Chapter 1: The Economic Problem
## Core Idea
- **Scarcity**: Limited resources, unlimited wants → central problem in economics.  
- **Economics** studies how societies allocate scarce resources to produce goods/services, meet needs, and distribute them.  
- Key concepts: *Scarcity, Choice, Efficiency, Well-being, Equity, Sustainability, Change, Interdependence, Intervention*.

---

## Factors of Production
- **Land**: Natural resources (minerals, oil, forests, water).  
- **Labour**: Human effort (physical & mental).  
- **Capital**: Man-made resources (machinery, tools, factories).  
- **Entrepreneurship**: Risk-taking, innovation, combining factors to create goods/services.

---

## Opportunity Cost
- **Definition**: Value of the next best alternative forgone.  
- Every choice involves a trade-off.  
- Example: Choosing dinner over a movie → opportunity cost = movie.  
- **Economic goods**: Produced with scarce resources → involve opportunity cost.  
- **Free goods**: Abundant, no opportunity cost (e.g., sunlight, air).

---

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC/PPF)
- Shows **maximum combinations of two goods** an economy can produce using available resources & technology.  
- **On the curve** = Productive efficiency (all resources fully used).  
- **Inside the curve** = Inefficiency (resources underused).  
- **Outside the curve** = Unattainable with current resources.  
- **Shift outward** = Economic growth (more resources/tech progress).  

---

## Three Basic Economic Questions
1. **What to produce?**  
   → Which goods/services should be made.  
2. **How to produce?**  
   → What combination of factors/techniques to use.  
3. **For whom to produce?**  
   → How output is distributed among individuals/groups.

---

## Economic Systems
- **Free Market**: Allocation mainly by supply & demand, minimal state intervention.  
- **Planned Economy**: Government decides what/how/for whom.  
- **Mixed Economy**: Blend of both. Most real-world economies fall here.

# Chapter 2: Demand, Supply & Elasticity
## Demand
- **Definition**: Quantity of a good consumers are willing & able to buy at a given price in a time period.  
- **Law of Demand**:  
  $$P \downarrow \;\Rightarrow\; Q_d \uparrow \quad \text{and vice versa}$$  
- **Demand function**:  
  $$Q = f(P)$$  

### Determinants of Demand
- Own price of the good.  
- Income of consumers.  
- Price of related goods:  
  - **Complements**: consumed together (car & petrol).  
  - **Substitutes**: alternatives (Coke & Pepsi).  
- Tastes/preferences.  
- Expectations of future prices.  
- Advertising.  
- Distribution of income.

### Types of Goods
- **Normal goods**: Demand ↑ when income ↑.  
- **Inferior goods**: Demand ↓ when income ↑.  

### Changes in Demand
- **Movement along curve** = price change.  
- **Shift of curve** = non-price determinant change (income, substitutes, etc.).  

---

## Supply
- **Definition**: Quantity producers are willing & able to sell at a given price in a time period.  
- **Law of Supply**:  
  $$P \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; Q_s \uparrow$$  

### Determinants of Supply
- Price.  
- Cost of production.  
- Technology.  
- Prices of related outputs.  
- Government policy.

### Changes in Supply
- **Movement along curve** = price change.  
- **Shift of curve** = change in costs, tech, policy, etc.

---

## Market Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium price (P\*)**: Where $Q_d = Q_s$.  
- Below P\*: shortage (excess demand).  
- Above P\*: surplus (excess supply).  
- **Market forces** push price toward equilibrium.

### Government Intervention
- **Price ceiling**: Max legal price (e.g., rent control).  
- **Price floor**: Min legal price (e.g., minimum wage).  

---

## Elasticity
### Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)
- **Definition**: Responsiveness of quantity demanded to price change.  
$$E_d = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}$$  

- **Types**:  
  - Elastic: $E_d > 1$  
  - Inelastic: $E_d < 1$  
  - Unitary: $E_d = 1$  
  - Perfectly elastic: $E_d = \infty$  
  - Perfectly inelastic: $E_d = 0$

- **Determinants**:  
  - Availability of substitutes.  
  - Proportion of income spent.  
  - Necessity vs luxury.  
  - Time horizon.

- **Elasticity & Revenue**:  
  - Elastic demand: $P \uparrow \Rightarrow TR \downarrow$  
  - Inelastic demand: $P \uparrow \Rightarrow TR \uparrow$  

### Income Elasticity of Demand
$$E_y = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta Y}$$  
- $E_y > 0$ → Normal good.  
- $E_y < 0$ → Inferior good.  
- $E_y > 1$ → Luxury good.  
- $0 < E_y < 1$ → Necessity.

### Cross-Price Elasticity
- Responsiveness of demand for one good to price change of another.  
- Complements: Negative.  
- Substitutes: Positive.

### Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)
$$E_s = \dfrac{\%\Delta Q_s}{\%\Delta P}$$  
- Elastic if $E_s > 1$, inelastic if $E_s < 1$.  
- Depends on production flexibility, spare capacity, and time period.

# Chapter 3: Efficiency & Equity
## Efficiency
- **Definition**: How well resources are used to maximize output & welfare.  
- **Static efficiency**: At a point in time.  
  - **Allocative efficiency**: $P = MC$ → resources match consumer preferences.  
  - **Productive efficiency**: Output at minimum average cost (AC).  

### Pareto Efficiency
- A state where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.

### PPF & Efficiency
- Points **on** PPF: Productive + Allocative efficiency.  
- Cannot increase production of one good without reducing another.

### Dynamic Efficiency
- Long-run improvements in efficiency via innovation, investment, and technology → economic growth.

---

## Equity
- **Equity**: Fairness in the distribution of resources.  
- Different from efficiency:  
  - Efficiency = maximizing the size of the “pie”.  
  - Equity = how the pie is divided.  

---

## Trade-Offs Between Efficiency & Equity
- Market equilibrium may be efficient but not equitable.  
- Example: A society may achieve efficiency but with unfair income distribution.  

# Chapter 4: Government in the Market
## Core Idea
- **Government intervention**: Regulatory actions taken by the state to affect or interfere with decisions made by individuals, groups, or firms regarding social and economic matters.  
- Markets alone do not always achieve socially optimal outcomes → government intervenes to correct **market failures** and promote **equity**.

---

## Reasons for Government Intervention
1. **Information**  
   - Markets may fail when buyers/sellers lack adequate information.  
   - Examples of government policies to improve information flows:  
     - Public education and extension services.  
     - Government-supported media & information delivery.  
     - Labeling requirements.  
     - Truth-in-advertising laws.  

2. **Externalities**  
   - **Definition**: Spillover costs/benefits of production or consumption that affect third parties without compensation.  
   - **Types of externalities**:  
     - **Negative externalities** (costs to society, e.g., pollution).  
     - **Positive externalities** (benefits to society, e.g., vaccination).  
     - **Production externalities** (arise during production process).  
     - **Consumption externalities** (arise during consumption).  

   - **Negative Externality Graph** 
     ![[image-20230203083115173 1.png]]
	 - MPC = Marginal Private Cost.  
     - MSC = Marginal Social Cost.  
     - Market overproduces (Q₁ > Q\*).  
     - Welfare loss created.  

   - **Positive Externality Graph** 
     ![[image-20230208084954664.png]]
     - MPB = Marginal Private Benefit.  
     - MSB = Marginal Social Benefit.  
     - Market underproduces (Q₁ < Q\*).  
     - Potential welfare gain if corrected.  

3. **Public Goods**  
   - Characteristics:  
     - **Non-rivalrous**: One person’s use does not reduce availability to others.  
     - **Non-excludable**: Cannot prevent non-payers from consuming.  
   - Examples: national security, public infrastructure, clean air, public research.  
   - Problem: **Free rider issue** → markets underprovide.  

4. **Noncompetitive Behavior**  
   - Markets sometimes dominated by a few or a single producer.  
   - Examples: monopoly, cartels, oligopoly.  
   - Issues: reduced output, higher prices, inefficiency.  
   - Government response:  
     - **Antitrust legislation**.  
     - Regulation of natural monopolies.  

5. **Distribution of Income & Wealth**  
   - Markets often result in unequal distribution.  
   - Governments use transfer policies to promote equity:  
     - Income & inheritance taxes.  
     - Social security systems.  
     - Welfare programs, healthcare, and education subsidies.

## Tools of Government Intervention
1. **Taxes**  
   - Imposed on goods/services to:  
     - Correct negative externalities (internalize external costs).  
     - Raise revenue for public expenditure.  
   - **Graph: Tax correcting externality**   
     - Optimum tax = MSC – MC.  
     ![[image-20230207165457620 1.png]]

2. **Subsidies**  
   - Financial aid provided to encourage production/consumption of goods with positive externalities.  
   - Examples: education, healthcare, renewable energy.  
   - **Graph: Subsidy correcting externality**  
     - Optimum subsidy = MC – MSC.
