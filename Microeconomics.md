## **Question** 2 — Market Equilibrium, Surplus and Shortage
(a) Define market equilibrium, excess demand (shortage), and excess supply (surplus). Draw a
fully-labelled D–S diagram identifying equilibrium P*, Q* and the directions of price pressure
when price is above/below equilibrium. (10)

Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a specific price.

- **Excess demand (shortage):** If the market price is set **below P***, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. The shortage puts upward pressure on price until equilibrium is restored.
- **Excess supply (surplus):** If the price is set above P, the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. This surplus creates downward pressure on price until it returns to P*.



(b) A normal good experiences a rise in consumer income. Use a diagram to analyse how
demand, equilibrium price and quantity change. Apply to a market you know. (10)

When consumer income rises, the demand curve for a normal good shifts to the right (D → D1) because people buy more at every price.

- the new demand curve intersects supply at a higher equilibrium point.
- The result is an increase in both equilibrium price (P* → P1) and equilibrium quantity (Q* → Q1).


Example (application): Consider the market for smartphones. As average household incomes increase, more consumers are willing to purchase higher-end phones. The demand curve shifts rightward, leading to higher prices and more units sold in equilibrium.

(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of a maximum price (price ceiling) to address affordability
problems (e.g., urban rents). Discuss shortages, and alternative policies. (10)

A maximum price (price ceiling) is a legal cap set below the equilibrium price (P*) to make a good more affordable.

- **Diagram explanation:** At the imposed ceiling, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied → a shortage emerges. For example, in the rental housing market, more people want to rent at the lower capped price, but landlords are less willing to supply housing.
- This leads to inefficiency: queues, informal markets (“black markets”), reduced quality of supply, and potential misallocation.


**Effectiveness:**

- Positives: Can improve affordability in the short run for those who actually obtain the good at the lower price.
- Negatives: Persistent shortages and under-supply mean many consumers still can’t access the good, defeating the policy’s goal.


**Alternative policies:**

- Subsidies for suppliers to encourage provision at lower prices.
- Targeted income support or housing vouchers so consumers can afford market rents without distorting prices.
- Increasing supply through new construction or tax incentives to landlords.

Thus, while price ceilings may offer temporary relief, they often worsen shortages; complementary or alternative policies tend to be more effective in the long run.

## **Question 1** — Scarcity, Choice and the PPC
(a) Define scarcity and opportunity cost. Explain the main assumptions of the production
possibilities curve (PPC/PPF) and draw a clearly labelled PPC showing efficient, inefficient, and
unattainable points. (10)



(b) Using your diagram, analyse how an increase in the quality/quantity of factors of production
affects potential output (outward shift) versus how cyclical unemployment appears (movement
inside the curve). Apply to a real context. (10)



(c) Evaluate the view that outward shifts of the PPC are always desirable. (10)


## **Question 2 — Market Equilibrium, Surplus and Shortage**

### (a) Market equilibrium, shortage, and surplus

Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a specific price. At this point, the market clears: there is no tendency for the price to change, and we denote equilibrium price as P and equilibrium quantity as Q.

- **Excess demand (shortage):** If the market price is set **below P***, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. The shortage puts upward pressure on price until equilibrium is restored.
    
- **Excess supply (surplus):** If the price is set above P, the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. This surplus creates downward pressure on price until it returns to P*.

So, in your D–S graph, P* and Q* are the intersection point, and arrows show the direction of price movement back to equilibrium when the market is out of balance.

### (b) Effect of rising income on a normal good

When consumer income rises, the demand curve for a **normal good** shifts to the **right (D → D1)** because people buy more at every price.

- On your diagram, the new demand curve intersects supply at a higher equilibrium point.
    
- The result is an **increase in both equilibrium price (P* → P1)** and **equilibrium quantity (Q* → Q1)**.
    

**Example (application):** Consider the market for smartphones. As average household incomes increase, more consumers are willing to purchase higher-end phones. The demand curve shifts rightward, leading to higher prices and more units sold in equilibrium.

### (c) Maximum price (price ceiling) evaluation

A **maximum price (price ceiling)** is a legal cap set **below the equilibrium price (P*)** to make a good more affordable.

- **Diagram explanation:** At the imposed ceiling, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied → a **shortage** emerges. For example, in the rental housing market, more people want to rent at the lower capped price, but landlords are less willing to supply housing.
    
- This leads to **inefficiency**: queues, informal markets (“black markets”), reduced quality of supply, and potential misallocation.
    

**Effectiveness:**

- Positives: Can improve affordability in the short run for those who actually obtain the good at the lower price.
    
- Negatives: Persistent shortages and under-supply mean many consumers still can’t access the good, defeating the policy’s goal.
    

**Alternative policies:**

- **Subsidies** for suppliers to encourage provision at lower prices.
    
- **Targeted income support or housing vouchers** so consumers can afford market rents without distorting prices.
    
- **Increasing supply** through new construction or tax incentives to landlords.
    

Thus, while price ceilings may offer temporary relief, they often worsen shortages; complementary or alternative policies tend to be more effective in the long run.

Would you like me to also **sketch how the three diagrams should look** (with labels like D, D1, S, P*, Q*, arrows, etc.) so you can replicate them easily?
