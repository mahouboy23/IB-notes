The question '**who is the knower**' has occupied the minds of philosophers and great thinkers for thousands of years, and is perhaps no closer to a definitive answer than it has ever been. Yet if we cannot know who we are as knowers, how can we know anything. 

In TOK we look at what each individual Knower 
How might contribute to the array of knowledge that human kind has access to. We will be interested on how we can best try to avoid deceiving ourselves or being deceived by others. We will examen where our current knowledge comes from and what has influenced us to think the way we do. Also we will be challenged to identify and question some of our assumption and biases and to raise our awareness of the extent to which who we are shapes what we know. 

**BIAS**: 
?
- Prejudice 
- Favoritism

We live in an age in which self identity and self estime are regarded as crucial to our health and well being at the same time, we are invented to take part into self improvement programs, and the selfie is perhaps the fastest growing genre in photography
