# who is the knower
Created: 2022-10-05

## INTRODUCTION: **Real life situation**

Question:
1. To what extent can you know yourself 
2. In what contexts is it possible for others to know you better than you know yourself

The question who is the knower has occupied the minds of philosophers and great thinkers for thousands of years, and is perhaps no closer to a definitive answer than it has ever been. Yet if we cannot know who we are as knowers, how can we know anything.
