the idea for my web app: 
I want to create a react web app that manages grade report for the IB program and help manage them by class (11th and 12th grade) and students with each teacher being a user that can input there grades for their own class and the coordinator with acc√®s to everything (will be the moderator). Students will also be able to get Access to there grade report and have automatic conversion in different format from french to GPA to English's grading system etc.... and people can download a pdf version all of this information stored in a central MySQL database with multiple tables for all info. The Teacher can set grade boundaries for their whole subject and for individual grades so that wen it is inputted in the app it is automatically converted to the IB grading format (over 7). The students can see there grades. There is also auto calculation of average and show worst and best grade anonymously. The coordinator can add and manage student, teacher and classes (add a student and then add him to a class or a teacher to a class ect...). and he has a general overview of everything.
All of this i am planning to use java-script react and node.js MySQL for the database. My code interpreter is VS code.

### Database Schema

1. **Users Table** (For storing user information including teachers, students, and coordinators)
    
    - `user_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `username` VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
    - `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - `role` ENUM('teacher', 'student', 'coordinator') NOT NULL
    - `full_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
2. **Classes Table** (For storing class details)
    
    - `class_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `class_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - `grade_level` ENUM('11', '12') NOT NULL
    - `subject` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - `teacher_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Users`(`user_id`)
3. **Grades Table** (For storing grades of students)
    
    - `grade_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `student_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Users`(`user_id`)
    - `class_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Classes`(`class_id`)
    - `grade_value` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL
    -  `total_value` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL AFTER
    - `trimester` ENUM('1', '2', '3') NOT NULL
4. **GradeBoundaries Table** (For storing grade boundaries for subjects)
    
    - `boundary_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `class_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Classes`(`class_id`)
    - `over_value` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL AFTER
    - `grades` TEXT NOT NULL
5. **StudentClasses Table** 

- `student_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Users(user_id) `
- `class_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Classes(class_id)`


I want you to implement all the functionality of the coordinatoor. In the overview we can add teacher's and students. in the classes we can add, remove and modify students and students. So i want you to give me a complete plan (no talk about how to implement) but the features and how to structure it in the pages and what needs to be done and the logic.
