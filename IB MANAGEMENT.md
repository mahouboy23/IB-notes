the idea for my web app: 
I want to create a react web app that manages grade report for the IB program and help manage them by class (11th and 12th grade) and students with each teacher being a user that can input there grades for their own class and the coordinator with acc√®s to everything (will be the moderator). Students will also be able to get Access to there grade report and have automatic conversion in different format from french to GPA to English's grading system etc.... and people can download a pdf version all of this information stored in a central MySQL database with multiple tables for all info. The Teacher can set grade boundaries for their whole subject and for individual grades so that wen it is inputted in the app it is automatically converted to the IB grading format (over 7). The students can see there grades. There is also auto calculation of average and show worst and best grade anonymously. The coordinator can add and manage student, teacher and classes (add a student and then add him to a class or a teacher to a class ect...). and he has a general overview of everything.
All of this i am planning to use java-script react and node.js MySQL for the database. My code interpreter is VS code.

### Database Schema

1. **Users Table** (For storing user information including teachers, students, and coordinators)
    
    - `user_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `username` VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
    - `password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - `role` ENUM('teacher', 'student', 'coordinator') NOT NULL
    - `full_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
2. **Classes Table** (For storing class details)
    
    - `class_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `class_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - `grade_level` ENUM('11', '12') NOT NULL
    - `subject` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - `teacher_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Users`(`user_id`)
3. **Grades Table** (For storing grades of students)
    
    - `grade_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `student_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Users`(`user_id`)
    - `class_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Classes`(`class_id`)
    - `grade_value` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL
    -  `total_value` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL AFTER
    - `trimester` ENUM('1', '2', '3') NOT NULL
4. **GradeBoundaries Table** (For storing grade boundaries for subjects)
    
    - `boundary_id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    - `class_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Classes`(`class_id`)
    - `over_value` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL AFTER
    - `grades` TEXT NOT NULL
5. **StudentClasses Table** 

- `student_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Users(user_id) `
- `class_id` INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `Classes(class_id)`


I want you to implement all the functionality of the coordinatoor. In the overview we can add teacher's and students. in the classes we can add, remove and modify students and students. So i want you to give me a complete plan (no talk about how to implement) but the features and how to structure it in the pages and what needs to be done and the logic.

## Overview of Coordinator Functionality

The coordinator's role in your React web app is central to managing the entire IB grade reporting system. The coordinator will have comprehensive access and control over users, classes, and grades. Below is a detailed plan for the coordinator's functionality, structured by pages and the logic behind them.

## Dashboard Page

- **Summary**: A landing page that provides a quick overview of the system's status, including the number of active classes, teachers, and students.
- **Features**:
    
    - Display total counts of users and classes.
    - Show recent activity, such as newly added classes or updated grades.
    - Provide alerts for any pending actions, like unassigned students or teachers.
    

## User Management Page

- **Summary**: A dedicated section for managing all user accounts within the system.
- **Features**:
    
    - Add new users, specifying their role (teacher, student, coordinator), full name, and credentials.
    - Edit existing user details, including changing roles or updating passwords.
    - Delete users who are no longer part of the program.
    - Search and filter users by name, role, or other criteria.
    

## Class Management Page

- **Summary**: A control panel for creating and maintaining class details.
- **Features**:
    
    - Create new classes by specifying the class name, grade level, subject, and associated teacher.
    - Edit class details, such as changing the teacher or subject name.
    - Remove classes that are no longer offered.
    - Assign and unassign students to classes, ensuring each student is placed appropriately.
    

## Grade Management Page

- **Summary**: An interface for overseeing the grading process and boundaries.
- **Features**:
    
    - Set and adjust grade boundaries for each subject, defining the conversion to the IB grading format.
    - View and manage individual student grades, including the ability to input new grades or adjust existing ones.
    - Automatically calculate averages, display the range of grades, and highlight the best and worst grades anonymously.
    - Generate reports on class performance, identifying areas of strength and improvement.
    

## Reporting and Export Page

- **Summary**: A utility page for generating and exporting grade reports.
- **Features**:
    
    - Allow students to access their grade reports in various formats (French, GPA, English grading system).
    - Enable the download of grade reports as PDFs for easy distribution.
    - Provide a system for automatic conversion of grades into different formats based on predefined rules.
    

## Settings Page

- **Summary**: A configuration page for system-wide settings and preferences.
- **Features**:
    
    - Manage system settings such as academic year, trimester dates, and default grading scales.
    - Configure access permissions and security settings, including password policies and session timeouts.
    - Handle backup and recovery options for the database to prevent data loss.
    

## Database and System Integration

- **Logic**:
    
    - Ensure that all user actions are reflected in the MySQL database in real-time.
    - Implement foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity across different tables.
    - Use transactions to handle operations that involve multiple tables, such as adding a student to a class.
    

## User Experience and Accessibility

- **Considerations**:
    
    - Design an intuitive and responsive user interface that adapts to different devices.
    - Implement accessibility features to accommodate users with disabilities.
    - Provide clear instructions and feedback to the coordinator for every action taken.
    

By structuring the coordinator's functionality across these pages and considering the logic behind each feature, you can create a comprehensive and user-friendly system for managing the IB grade reporting process.
