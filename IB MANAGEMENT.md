Now i want you to implement the frontend part and give me the complete code for the ## Class Management Page

the idea for my web app: 
I want to create a react web app that manages grade report for the IB program and help manage them by class (11th and 12th grade) and students with each teacher being a user that can input there grades for their own class and the coordinator with accès to everything (will be the moderator). Students will also be able to get Access to there grade report and have automatic conversion in different format from french to GPA to English's grading system etc.... and people can download a pdf version all of this information stored in a central MySQL database with multiple tables for all info. The Teacher can set grade boundaries for their whole subject and for individual grades so that wen it is inputted in the app it is automatically converted to the IB grading format (over 7). The students can see there grades. There is also auto calculation of average and show worst and best grade anonymously. The coordinator can add and manage student, teacher and classes (add a student and then add him to a class or a teacher to a class ect...). and he has a general overview of everything.
All of this i am planning to use java-script react and node.js MySQL for the database. My code interpreter is VS code.

## Overview of Coordinator Functionality

The coordinator's role in your React web app is central to managing the entire IB grade reporting system. The coordinator will have comprehensive access and control over users, classes, and grades. Below is a detailed plan for the coordinator's functionality, structured by pages and the logic behind them.

## User Management Page

- **Summary**: A dedicated section for managing all user accounts within the system.
- **Features**:
    
    - Add new users, specifying their role (teacher, student, coordinator), full name, and credentials.
    - Edit existing user details, including changing roles or updating passwords.
    - Delete users who are no longer part of the program.
    - Search and filter users by name, role, or other criteria.

## User Management Page

- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `POST /api/users` to add new users.
    - `GET /api/users` to list users with search and filter capabilities.
    - `PUT /api/users/:userId` to edit user details.
    - `DELETE /api/users/:userId` to remove users.
    
- **Logic**: Implement CRUD operations for user management. Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place.

## Dashboard Part in overview page

- **Summary**: A landing page that provides a quick overview of the system's status, including the number of active classes, teachers, and students.
- **Features**:
    
    - Display total counts of users and classes.
    - Show recent activity, such as newly added classes or updated grades.
    - Provide alerts for any pending actions, like unassigned students or teachers.
    

## User Management Page

- **Summary**: A dedicated section for managing all user accounts within the system.
- **Features**:
    
    - Add new users, specifying their role (teacher, student, coordinator), full name, and credentials.
    - Edit existing user details, including changing roles or updating passwords.
    - Delete users who are no longer part of the program.
    - Search and filter users by name, role, or other criteria.
    

## Class Management Page

- **Summary**: A control panel for creating and maintaining class details.
- **Features**:
    
    - Create new classes by specifying the class name, grade level, subject, and associated teacher.
    - Edit class details, such as changing the teacher or subject name.
    - Remove classes that are no longer offered.
    - Assign and unassign students to classes, ensuring each student is placed appropriately.
    

## Grade Management in overview page

- **Summary**: An interface for overseeing the grades
- **Features**:
	
    - Generate reports on class performance.
	

## Settings Page

- **Summary**: A configuration page for system-wide settings and preferences.
- **Features**:
    
    - Manage system settings such as academic year, trimester dates, and default grading scales.
    - Configure access permissions and security settings, including password policies and session timeouts.


## Database and System Integration

- **Logic**:
    
    - Ensure that all user actions are reflected in the MySQL database in real-time.
    - Implement foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity across different tables.
    - Use transactions to handle operations that involve multiple tables, such as adding a student to a class.
    

## User Experience and Accessibility

- **Considerations**:
    
    - Design an intuitive and responsive user interface that adapts to different devices.
    - Provide clear instructions and feedback to the coordinator for every action taken.
    

# backend
## Dashboard part in Overview Page

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/dashboard`
- **Logic**: Aggregate and return counts of users, classes, and recent activities. This may involve querying multiple tables and summarizing the data.

## User Management Page

- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `POST /api/users` to add new users.
    - `GET /api/users` to list users with search and filter capabilities.
    - `PUT /api/users/:userId` to edit user details.
    - `DELETE /api/users/:userId` to remove users.
    
- **Logic**: Implement CRUD operations for user management. Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place.

## Class Management Page

- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `POST /api/classes` to create new classes.
    - `GET /api/classes` to list all classes.
    - `PUT /api/classes/:classId` to edit class details.
    - `DELETE /api/classes/:classId` to remove classes.
    - `POST /api/classes/:classId/students` to assign students to classes.
    - `DELETE /api/classes/:classId/students/:studentId` to unassign students from classes.
    
- **Logic**: Manage class details. Ensure referential integrity when adding or removing students from classes.

## Grade Management part in Overview Page

- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `GET /api/grades/report` to generate class performance reports.
    
- **Logic**: Compile grade data to create comprehensive reports on class performance, including averages and grade distributions. bets grade and worst grande and there is an option to filter for the class

## Settings Page

- **Endpoints**:
    
    - `GET /api/settings` to retrieve current settings.
    - `PUT /api/settings` to update system settings.
    
- **Logic**: Allow the coordinator to manage system-wide settings, including academic calendar and grading scales.

## Database and System Integration

- **Logic**:
    
    - Ensure that all coordinator actions are properly reflected in the database.
    - Use transactions where necessary to maintain data consistency.
    - Implement foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
    

## User Experience and Accessibility

- **Logic**:
    
    - Design the API to be intuitive and consistent.
    - Provide meaningful status codes and messages for all operations.
    

	## Additional Endpoints for Coordinator Role
	
	- **Endpoints**:
	    
	    - `POST /api/users` to add teachers and students.
	    - `PUT /api/users/:userId` to edit user roles and details.
	    - `DELETE /api/users/:userId` to delete users.
	    - `POST /api/classes` to create classes.
	    - `PUT /api/classes/:classId` to edit classes.
	    - `DELETE /api/classes/:classId` to delete classes.
	    - `POST /api/classes/:classId/students/:studentId` to assign students to classes.
	    - `DELETE /api/classes/:classId/students/:studentId` to remove students from classes.
	    - `GET /api/grades` to view all grades.
	    - `POST /api/grades` to add grades.
	    - `PUT /api/grades/:gradeId` to update grades.
	    - `DELETE /api/grades/:gradeId` to delete grades.
	    
	- **Logic**: Implement the necessary backend logic to support these endpoints, ensuring that the coordinator can perform all required actions.

The provided `gradeRoutes.js` file already includes routes for managing grades, and you will need to create similar route files for managing users and classes. Each controller will need to handle the logic for its respective domain, such as adding, updating, and deleting records, as well as handling any special business logic like grade conversions or report generation.

ok there is a few thing's to modify :
- first of all the assign student should show a little modal where it lists out all the students but there is a search bar to search for the student using : "full_name".
- remove student should show all the students of that class and have a delete button where we can delete that student in  modal. 
- for the teacher it should selection in add and update/edit modals it should show a list of all teachers and you can then assign or change it.
- the delete/add/edit submit is not working even tho the actuall methode's in the backend are (tested with postman)
