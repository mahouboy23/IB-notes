<!--SR:!2023-01-21,3,210-->

All of us, as knowers, bring our own perspective to every situations from the people and places we like to the political opinions we hold. 

If you think back to the things you liked or disliked when you were very young, you would probably have  very different opinons of them now. As our perspectives change so too do our taste and opinions. Sometimes, our personal perspective can help us to understand others at other times, it can prevent us from understanding or even wanting to understand there opinions or there point of vue.
