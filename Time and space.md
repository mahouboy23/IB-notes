## (AOE) Point of view and culture context  

When you read a text and try to understand it's meaning you must consider various items, including the topic and purpose of the piece. Two additional items that are also important to consider are the authors point of view and cultural context of the reading. 

**Point of view**: refers to the perspective used by the writer in a story, article or essay. It allows the reader who is telling the story or making the argument. Point of view can be broken down into three types each types has it's own perspective about the evens within the writing.

*first point of view*: I
*second point of view* : you, your
*third point of view*: she, he, it

#### a) first person point of view
In the first point of view the writer uses the word I when writing. You as the writer gets to read the story from the perspective of one person (The Narrator). When the narrator shares he or she's thoughts of what is happening he or she has limited point of view because the story is only coming from that person's perspective. first point of view is usually used in autobiographical or other personal writing such as journal. 

#### b) second person point of view
In the second person point of view the writer uses the pronouns you or your which generally refers to the reader. It is most often used for instruction, manuals and lesson, where the writer directly refers to the reader. An author may also chose the write in a person point of view to porously draw the reader in the story also it is not seen as first or third person, second person point of view can be a very affective type of writing when the writer has a specific prepose in mind.

#### c) third person point of view 
Finally in the third person point of view the writer uses the pronouns he, she, it form either an omniscient perspective or from a limited perspective. Using third person omniscient the writers takes on Gods eye's perspective and shares information about all characters and all the action's taking place. The thirds person limited point view follows the perspective of one person as a reader you know you are reading third person omniscient when the author let's you know what is going on inside the mind of multiple characters in the text. In the third person limited the writer lets inside the ming of only one character. Most academic writings is written in the third person.

**Cultural context**: of text helps the reader understand what is happening and why. It is made up of several factors including setting or location, background, cultures, believes and community. Each of this components effects how a reader looks at and understand what is happening in that text. For exemple to understand the plot of the book "To kill a mauking bird" from Lee Harper the readers must think about where the story is taking place (setting or location) when the story is taking place (year or time) who is involved (characters) and what values and believes those characters have. The setting of the book is in the racially divided deep south of the united states
during the great depression in the 1930. The main character Atticus Finch is a lawyer who is also a widowed father of two children. Mr Finch is called upon the defend an African American man who us accused of raping a white women. Knowing the culturel context of the book makes to understand better the plot and what Mr Finch is doing. In this way culturel context becomes just as important to understanding the plot of the novel as is knowing about the characters and the pont of views the story is being tolled.
