Created: 2022-10-05 

QUOTATION:
1. "The things that make me different are the things that make me"
2. "If i speak of myself in different ways, that is because I look at myself in different ways."
3. "Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom"

QUESTION:
1. TO what extent do you agree or disagree with the quotation ? 
2. How might you challenge the quotation ?
3. Does the quotation challenge or confirm your own perspective on who you are ? 

ANSWERS:
1. I agree to a certain extent because being different and having different aptitudes and qualities separate me from other people and defines who i am but there other aspects to what makes me who i am. 
2. i agree
3. I dont necessarily agree with this because some people dont know who there are or who they want to be but still find a way to learn and evolve and become better people
