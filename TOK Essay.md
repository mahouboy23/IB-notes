## Methodology Essay writing

Writing a TOK essay is not so much about answering a question's, rather it is about shedding light on a knowledge question. That is what you are trying to do. We are unlikely to come up with a definite solution.
Because the TOK essay deals with open ended and contestable question's, there is an important personal element to it. while you may be able to learn from similar explorations made by other's, it is important that your essay voices your opinions and arguments and that you acknowledge your own perspective and assumption's as a Knower.

To explore a knowledge question you need to 
- explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters.
- Clarify the meaning of any keywords or key terms in the essay title. 
- Undercover hidden assumption that are taken for granted.
- Offer a thesis statement that answers the knowledge question.
- Argue your case for your thesis with a clear argument or a coherent sequence of ideas.
- Consider different ways of thinking about the problem.
- Investigate and evaluate different perspectives.
- You need to identify, construct and evaluate both arguments and counter arguments

## TOK essay Introduction
Picture this: you're at a crossroads, where the Knowledge of the past meets the discoveries of today. It's a place where we ponder a timeless question: Does new always mean better? and how does this relate to the evidence. We will explore two areas of Knowledge, the natural sciences and history.
We've all felt the pull of the "latest and greatest." In an era of instant information and rapid progress, the appeal of fresh evidence is hard to resist. But, as we'll soon discover, there's more to this. We're embarking on a quest to uncover the true power of evidence.
Our journey will take us through the realms of the natural sciences, where we rely on what we see and test, and history, where the past sheds light on our present. Along the way, we'll uncover the hidden complexities of this assumption. We'll peel back the surface to reveal the subtle ideas and important implications that often go unnoticed when we favor the "latest."



Quote: "In the pursuit of knowledge, the newest is not always the truest." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's timeless words resonate. This inquiry compels us to scrutinize the dynamics of evidence in the areas of natural sciences and history. In an era driven by a relentless quest for innovation and novelty, it's all too common to equate 'new' with 'superior.' However, as we journey through these domains of knowledge, we shall unveil the intricate nuances concealed beneath the surface of this assumption. Our quest is to unearth the authentic potency of evidence, transcending the allure of immediacy.


“One of the deepest impulses in man is the impulse to record, to scratch a drawing on a tusk or keep a diary… The enduring value of the past is, one might say, the very basis of civilisation.”  
**John Jay Chapman, American author (1862-1933)**

"Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the very deepest feelings of human nature. It is a matter of depth. Art is not a matter of aesthetic likings, but of what one may call cognitive values. But in order to see these values, we must be taught to see through the eyes of others, to utilize their emotions and experiences. That is where art enters the picture. Art is not a matter of taste, but a matter of taste training."
**art historian Ernst Gombrich:**

"All experience are subjective" - **Gregory Bateson**
