## Methodology Essay writing

Writing a TOK essay is not so much about answering a question's, rather it is about shedding light on a knowledge question. That is what you are trying to do. We are unlikely to come up with a definite solution.
Because the TOK essay deals with open ended and contestable question's, there is an important personal element to it. while you may be able to learn from similar explorations made by other's, it is important that your essay voices your opinions and arguments and that you acknowledge your own perspective and assumption's as a Knower.

To explore a knowledge question you need to 
- explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters.
- Clarify the meaning of any keywords or key terms in the essay title. 
- Undercover hidden assumption that are taken for granted.
- Offer a thesis statement that answers the knowledge question.
- Argue your case for your thesis with a clear argument or a coherent sequence of ideas.
- Consider different ways of thinking about the problem.
- Investigate and evaluate different perspectives.
- You need to identify, construct and evaluate both arguments and counter arguments 
- Use specific examples or evidence to make a point or support a discussion
- Asses and evaluate supporting evidence.
- Make relevant connections, explore links and comparisons between areas of knowledge where relevant.
- Apply the 12 Tok concepts and ideas as you see fit.
- Think thew the impaction's of an argument or conclusion and what follows.

## My Tok essay outline

I want you to know start writing the first part of the body with a claim and then after relate it to the tok prescribed essay title. you can use one of the guiding ideas, also here is abit of information: 
ToK Essay May 2024 Title 6: Recent evidence & pursuit of
knowledge.
Clarifying the terms of the Q: The key TOK concept here - 'evidence' - underlines a key
focus for writing the essay: the use (or misused) of evidence in the process of accepting
or rejecting knowledge claims or distinguishing between old and new knowledge.
'Recent', and its opposite 'earlier' or 'outdated', indicates the time factor in the process of
gathering evidence. ...
Developing the Q: Before you engage with the title, ensure you know the difference
between 'evidence' and 'proof. In terms of logic, to 'prove' something involves a
reasoning process - making an inference - from starting premises to a conclusion which
makes a knowledge claim. And knowers make inferences about all sorts of things but in
different ways. Inferential thinking or proof can be categorised in at least these three
ways of reasoning: inductive. deductive and abductive .
Theme Connections: The politicians making the policies that govern society require
them to be evidence-based; that is, based on empirical data and research. When
policymakers use evidence-based policies (OT4)...
Knowledge Questions: How far is the most recent evidence the strongest only because
it's freshest in our memories? Who is too quick to assume the most recent evidence is
the strongest?
Perspectives
N Sciences: There have been numerous cases in which NS experts have been quick to
jump to conclusions based on recent evidence and had to change their minds. In 1996,
researchers claimed to have discovered evidence of life on Mars when they examined a
Martian meteorite found in Antarctica, known as ALH 84001. They found tiny structures
and chemical compounds that they argued could only be explained by the presence of
ancient Martian microorganisms...

# TOK essay introduction: 
  
Reflecting on the interplay between new discoveries and established truths, this essay embarks on an exploration within the realms of natural sciences and history. I recall, vividly, a moment from my youth, when a visit to a museum unveiled the grandeur of the Spinosaurus, challenging my then-unquestioned acceptance of dinosaurs as purely terrestrial beings. This personal revelation mirrors the broader theme of our inquiry: the evaluation of evidence, both empirical and theoretical, across disciplines. Here, we question the premise: Are we too quick to accept the most recent evidence as the strongest? By delving into cases such as the aquatic adaptations of Spinosaurus in natural sciences, and the historical reevaluation of the Vinland Map, alongside theoretical advancements in quantum computing and historical events like "The Great Dying," we aim to uncover the nuanced dynamics of evidence evaluation. This essay, therefore, seeks to not merely present a binary stance but to unfold the complexities and consequences of our haste or hesitance in embracing new knowledge, ultimately shedding light on the intricate dance between discovery and skepticism.

# Tok essay body:
  
In the domain of natural sciences, the discovery of the Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus Tail stands as a paramount example of how new empirical evidence can challenge and extend our understanding of prehistoric life. This discovery, shedding light on the aquatic lifestyle of the Spinosaurus, significantly diverged from the previously held belief that dinosaurs were predominantly terrestrial creatures. The revelation that Spinosaurus possessed adaptations for an aquatic environment, including a tail designed for swimming, marked a pivotal shift in paleontological thought and opened new avenues for research into dinosaur ecology and behavior.
This finding, as highlighted in paleontological studies, underscores the importance of empirical evidence in the continuous evolution of scientific knowledge. It illustrates the necessity for scientists to remain adaptable and open to revising long-standing theories in light of new data. Furthermore, the Spinosaurus discovery exemplifies the dynamic interplay between evidence and hypothesis in the natural sciences, demonstrating how each new discovery can significantly impact our understanding of the natural world. Through this example, we observe the critical role that empirical evidence plays in challenging established paradigms, encouraging a deeper and more nuanced exploration of our planet's prehistoric life.

  
In the realm of history, the reevaluation of the Vinland Map serves as a compelling illustration of how empirical evidence can profoundly reshape our understanding of historical narratives. Initially heralded as proof of Norse exploration of North America predating Columbus, subsequent technological analyses have debunked this assertion, revealing the map as a modern forgery. This critical finding was made possible through sophisticated examination techniques that analyzed the map's ink composition, uncovering anachronistic materials inconsistent with the purported age of the document.
This instance highlights the vital role of empirical evidence in historical scholarship, demonstrating how new technologies and methodologies can challenge and overturn established historical claims. The Vinland Map controversy not only corrected a significant historical misconception but also emphasized the importance of rigorous, evidence-based scrutiny in the authentication of historical artifacts. It serves as a cautionary tale against the uncritical acceptance of new evidence without thorough verification, underscoring the necessity for skepticism and critical analysis in historical research.
Through this example, we see the dynamic nature of historical knowledge, where advancements in technology and methodological approaches continuously offer new lenses through which to view and interpret the past. The Vinland Map's reexamination thus exemplifies the ongoing dialogue between the present and the past, reminding us that history is not a static field but one that is ever-evolving in light of new empirical discoveries.

# Introduction

In our modern, technology-driven world, it is easy to see the appeal of the newest discoveries and latest evidence. With unprecedented access to information, we often privilege what is immediate, viewing recent findings as most authoritative due to their relative newness. However, as the philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe cautioned, “the newest is not always the truest.” This essay will critically examine whether we are too hasty in presuming recent evidence to be strongest through an analysis of the natural sciences and history.
The natural sciences are dynamic fields where technological advances continuously generate novel evidence to test established understandings. At the same time, some seminal scientific works were once rejected before ultimately revolutionizing their domains. Similarly, history seeks reliable truths about the past but must continually reinterpret artifacts and documents through new lenses. By exploring examples from each area in turn, this essay will demonstrate how the assumption of recency translates not necessarily to validity.
Through comparing how the natural sciences and history approach new evidence, important insights will emerge around when recent findings should and should not be taken as decisive. A balanced perspective is needed to avoid dismissing past understandings prematurely at the altar of latest information. Ultimately, this essay aims to bring perspective to the relationship between newness and significance in knowledge by challenging the uncritical elevation of recency.

# Body (natural sciences *work in progress*)
When considering whether we are too quick to assume the most recent evidence is strongest, it's important to consider different perspectives on who exactly "we" refers to. Does it mean humanity collectively, driven by the novelty and flash of recent discoveries in a world of constant technological advancement? Or does it specifically apply to those working within knowledge-producing fields like the natural sciences?
For experts in areas reliant on gathering empirical evidence, such as genetics, new techniques undoubtedly aid the derivation of strong recent data in potent ways. The past few decades have seen revolutionary tools that have transformed scientific inquiry, from sequencing the first genomes to editing DNA with precision. Technologies like whole genome sequencing now allow collection and analysis of vast troves genetic information from huge populations with minimal effort. Researchers leverage these powerful methods to derive compelling links between inheritance patterns and illnesses. Findings derived from enormous recent datasets using CRISPR and other cutting-edge methods suggest the firmest understandings yet of how our traits and predispositions arise.

The immense scale and sophistication of genetics research today would have been unthinkable without technological progress. When considering genetics as a case study, it's understandable why evidence generated through state-of-the-art means may appear overwhelmingly definitive. In fields like genetics, techniques enabling collection of huge datasets and rigorous testing of hypotheses lend strong support for theories based on recent evidence. As technology continuously improves methods for examining the natural world, findings derived using cutting-edge means become seen as definitive within specialized communities. Over time, accepted understandings drawn from landmark initial investigations are built upon further by successive works applying newly available techniques.

This process incrementally reinforces confidence in theories as multiple independent studies bolster early conclusions. Practitioners trust findings enabled through reliable experimentation more than notions lacking robust validation. While openness to revision remains key, natural scientists perceive knowledge affirmed with extensive backing from repetitive experiments under varying conditions as surer than theories unsupported or contradicted by available evidence. Therefore, within domains continuously refining empirical investigation, latest understandings enjoy strong reputation when meeting standards of replicable, quantifiable proof applied consistently through successive works.

While recent evidence enabled by innovative techniques understandably assumes repute within specialized fields, this affinity risks sidelining valuable insights arising through more humble means. As genetics itself shows, revolutionary thinking sometimes emerges independently of prevailing technological winds. In the 1940s and 50s, Barbara McClintock conducted pioneering work on corn that contradicted acceptance views of the time despite employing only basic observation. Through diligent study without modern aids, she uncovered mobile genetic elements in chromosomes, revealing a layer of complexity eluding others.

However, McClintock's revelation of "jumping genes" faced skepticism from those wedded more rigidly to existing precepts than open inquiry. Her evidence contravened entrenched stances yet has since withstood the test of time. While initially dismissed, later corroborating experiments established her watershed idea as visionary rather than wrong. This example cautions the natural sciences against too swiftly relegating past understandings on grounds of perceived inadequacy alone.

Even rudimentary evidence thoughtfully marshalled through painstaking investigation holds potential to reshape prevailing narratives, if impartially evaluated on merit rather than bias toward novelty. As was shown, theoretical revolutions sometimes originate from the very lack of complication defining earlier eras yet allow problems previously invisible to emerge. This suggests modern evidence, however powerful, does not necessarily surpass all predecessors in reliability or significance. Discoveries of every age may augment collective knowledge when vetted rigorously rather than being preemptively discredited.

# Body (History *Not finished*)
Historical research relies on understanding the past through available evidence like artifacts, documents and accounts. This allows narratives of bygone eras to be reconstructed. In this section, I will discuss whether recent discoveries provide the strongest insights in history, or if reinterpreting older evidence can also challenge established views.

For my first point, I argue that in history recent evidence uncovered Through archaeological excavations or archives can offer compelling perspectives. As an example, the recent discovery of Annius Domesticus' previously unknown manuscripts from Ancient Rome have provided invaluable eyewitness accounts of certain eras. Found in 2020, these manuscripts dated to around 80 CE include detailed descriptions of gladiatorial contests, imperial court life, and military campaigns absent from other sources. Access to this newly found primary evidence has allowed historians to strengthen understandings of political, social and cultural aspects of the late Roman republic in ways not possible before. The level of direct observation and unfiltered context these new materials provide can make the primary source accounts they contain difficult to dismiss.

However, for my counterargument I note that reinvestigating older evidence through alternative frameworks can also pose interpretative challenges. For instance, the view of the fall of the Western Roman Empire has faced reevaluation. Where historians once primarily attributed the collapse to invading forces, modern interdisciplinary lenses have reconsidered other social, economic and environmental factors. Byzantine records from after the 5th century CE along with studies such as paleoclimate research have allowed problematic assumptions to be re-examined. This example shows we cannot always take the earliest perspectives as definitive, as older sources subjected to innovative scrutiny may stimulate new credible conclusions just as contemporary discoveries do.
