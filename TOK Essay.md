## Methodology Essay writing

Writing a TOK essay is not so much about answering a question's, rather it is about shedding light on a knowledge question. That is what you are trying to do. We are unlikely to come up with a definite solution.
Because the TOK essay deals with open ended and contestable question's, there is an important personal element to it. while you may be able to learn from similar explorations made by other's, it is important that your essay voices your opinions and arguments and that you acknowledge your own perspective and assumption's as a Knower.

To explore a knowledge question you need to 
- explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters.
- Clarify the meaning of any keywords or key terms in the essay title. 
- Undercover hidden assumption that are taken for granted.
- Offer a thesis statement that answers the knowledge question.
- Argue your case for your thesis with a clear argument or a coherent sequence of ideas.
- Consider different ways of thinking about the problem.
- Investigate and evaluate different perspectives.
- You need to identify, construct and evaluate both arguments and counter arguments 
- Use specific examples or evidence to make a point or support a discussion
- Asses and evaluate supporting evidence.

## TOK essay Introduction
Picture this: you're at a crossroads, where the wisdom of the past meets the discoveries of today. It's a place where we ponder a timeless question: Does new always mean better? We're about to dive into the world of evidence and time, exploring two areas of understandingâ€”the natural sciences and history.
We've all felt the pull of the "latest and greatest." In an era of instant information and rapid progress, the appeal of fresh evidence is hard to resist. But, as we'll soon discover, there's more to this story. We're embarking on a quest to uncover the true power of evidence.
Our journey will take us through the realms of the natural sciences, where we rely on what we see and test, and history, where the past sheds light on our present. Along the way, we'll uncover the hidden complexities of this assumption. We'll peel back the surface to reveal the subtle ideas and important implications that often go unnoticed when we favor the "latest."
Our mission? To bridge the gap between simple and complex, to make the intricate more accessible, and to engage in a conversation that goes beyond time. As we unravel the threads of time and historical knowledge, we'll gain a deeper understanding of how our understanding evolves. So, get ready for a journey that's as enlightening as it is captivating.
