## Methodology Essay writing

Writing a TOK essay is not so much about answering a question's, rather it is about shedding light on a knowledge question. That is what you are trying to do. We are unlikely to come up with a definite solution.
Because the TOK essay deals with open ended and contestable question's, there is an important personal element to it. while you may be able to learn from similar explorations made by other's, it is important that your essay voices your opinions and arguments and that you acknowledge your own perspective and assumption's as a Knower.

To explore a knowledge question you need to 
- explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters.
- Clarify the meaning of any keywords or key terms in the essay title. 
- Undercover hidden assumption that are taken for granted.
- Offer a thesis statement that answers the knowledge question.
- Argue your case for your thesis with a clear argument or a coherent sequence of ideas.
- Consider different ways of thinking about the problem.
- Investigate and evaluate different perspectives.
- You need to identify, construct and evaluate both arguments and counter arguments 
- Use specific examples or evidence to make a point or support a discussion
- Asses and evaluate supporting evidence.
- Make relevant connections, explore links and comparisons between areas of knowledge where relevant.
- Apply the 12 Tok concepts and ideas as you see fit.
- Think thew the impaction's of an argument or conclusion and what follows.

## My Tok essay outline

I want you to know start writing the first part of the body with a claim and then after relate it to the tok prescribed essay title. you can use one of the guiding ideas, also here is abit of information: 
ToK Essay May 2024 Title 6: Recent evidence & pursuit of
knowledge.
Clarifying the terms of the Q: The key TOK concept here - 'evidence' - underlines a key
focus for writing the essay: the use (or misused) of evidence in the process of accepting
or rejecting knowledge claims or distinguishing between old and new knowledge.
'Recent', and its opposite 'earlier' or 'outdated', indicates the time factor in the process of
gathering evidence. ...
Developing the Q: Before you engage with the title, ensure you know the difference
between 'evidence' and 'proof. In terms of logic, to 'prove' something involves a
reasoning process - making an inference - from starting premises to a conclusion which
makes a knowledge claim. And knowers make inferences about all sorts of things but in
different ways. Inferential thinking or proof can be categorised in at least these three
ways of reasoning: inductive. deductive and abductive .
Theme Connections: The politicians making the policies that govern society require
them to be evidence-based; that is, based on empirical data and research. When
policymakers use evidence-based policies (OT4)...
Knowledge Questions: How far is the most recent evidence the strongest only because
it's freshest in our memories? Who is too quick to assume the most recent evidence is
the strongest?
Perspectives
N Sciences: There have been numerous cases in which NS experts have been quick to
jump to conclusions based on recent evidence and had to change their minds. In 1996,
researchers claimed to have discovered evidence of life on Mars when they examined a
Martian meteorite found in Antarctica, known as ALH 84001. They found tiny structures
and chemical compounds that they argued could only be explained by the presence of
ancient Martian microorganisms...

# TOK essay introduction: 
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the newest is not always the truest," wisely cautioned Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. With these words as our guide, let's embark on a journey that takes us through the realms of the natural sciences and history, as we seek to answer a fundamental question: "Are we too quick to assume that the most recent evidence is inevitably the strongest?"

Imagine this: You're exploring a path where the wisdom of the past meets the exciting discoveries of today. We live in an era where we're constantly bombarded with new information, and it's easy to fall for the appeal of what's brand new. But, as we delve deeper into this topic, we'll start to see that things aren't always as they seem.

Our adventure will lead us through two areas of knowledge: the natural sciences, where we rely on what we see and test, and history, where we look to the past to understand the present. Along the way, we'll uncover the hidden complexities of this idea. We'll peel back the surface to discover the subtle ideas and important consequences that often go unnoticed when we favor the "latest."

Goethe's words encourage us to question the dynamics of evidence in the natural sciences and history. In a world driven by a never-ending quest for what's new, we often assume that 'new' means 'better.' But on our journey through these domains of knowledge, we aim to find out if this assumption holds true. Our goal is to reveal the real power of evidence, going beyond the charm of what's immediate.

# Tok essay body:
Let's dive into the heart of our exploration by addressing a fundamental claim: "Recent evidence is inherently the strongest." This assertion resonates with a common perception - that what's new always carries the most weight. But does this belief hold true when it comes to our pursuit of knowledge?

To tackle this, we'll begin with a critical observation: who exactly are the "we" that tend to place unwavering trust in the most recent evidence? Is it the collective human consciousness, driven by a desire for the latest and the shiniest, or does it extend to certain professionals and experts who work within specialized fields, such as the natural sciences? In essence, the perspective of who "we" are can significantly influence our stance on this matter.
In a world marked by ever-advancing technology, where the information flows in torrents, it's no surprise that the 'new' can seem irresistible. The question arises: does our sense of being swayed by what's recent merely stem from a fascination with novelty, or does it have deeper roots in our society's relentless march towards progress? This technological advancement is a powerful force shaping our relationship with evidence

# Introduction

In our modern, technology-driven world, it is easy to see the appeal of the newest discoveries and latest evidence. With unprecedented access to information, we often privilege what is immediate, viewing recent findings as most authoritative due to their relative newness. However, as the philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe cautioned, “the newest is not always the truest.” This essay will critically examine whether we are too hasty in presuming recent evidence to be strongest through an analysis of the natural sciences and history.
The natural sciences are dynamic fields where technological advances continuously generate novel evidence to test established understandings. At the same time, some seminal scientific works were once rejected before ultimately revolutionizing their domains. Similarly, history seeks reliable truths about the past but must continually reinterpret artifacts and documents through new lenses. By exploring examples from each area in turn, this essay will demonstrate how the assumption of recency translates not necessarily to validity.
Through comparing how the natural sciences and history approach new evidence, important insights will emerge around when recent findings should and should not be taken as decisive. A balanced perspective is needed to avoid dismissing past understandings prematurely at the altar of latest information. Ultimately, this essay aims to bring perspective to the relationship between newness and significance in knowledge by challenging the uncritical elevation of recency.

# Body (natural sciences *work in progress*)
When considering whether we are too quick to assume the most recent evidence is strongest, it's important to consider different perspectives on who exactly "we" refers to. Does it mean humanity collectively, driven by the novelty and flash of recent discoveries in a world of constant technological advancement? Or does it specifically apply to those working within knowledge-producing fields like the natural sciences?
For experts in areas reliant on gathering empirical evidence, such as genetics, new techniques undoubtedly aid the derivation of strong recent data in potent ways. The past few decades have seen revolutionary tools that have transformed scientific inquiry, from sequencing the first genomes to editing DNA with precision. Technologies like whole genome sequencing now allow collection and analysis of vast troves genetic information from huge populations with minimal effort. Researchers leverage these powerful methods to derive compelling links between inheritance patterns and illnesses. Findings derived from enormous recent datasets using CRISPR and other cutting-edge methods suggest the firmest understandings yet of how our traits and predispositions arise.

The immense scale and sophistication of genetics research today would have been unthinkable without technological progress. When considering genetics as a case study, it's understandable why evidence generated through state-of-the-art means may appear overwhelmingly definitive. In fields like genetics, techniques enabling collection of huge datasets and rigorous testing of hypotheses lend strong support for theories based on recent evidence. As technology continuously improves methods for examining the natural world, findings derived using cutting-edge means become seen as definitive within specialized communities. Over time, accepted understandings drawn from landmark initial investigations are built upon further by successive works applying newly available techniques.

This process incrementally reinforces confidence in theories as multiple independent studies bolster early conclusions. Practitioners trust findings enabled through reliable experimentation more than notions lacking robust validation. While openness to revision remains key, natural scientists perceive knowledge affirmed with extensive backing from repetitive experiments under varying conditions as surer than theories unsupported or contradicted by available evidence. Therefore, within domains continuously refining empirical investigation, latest understandings enjoy strong reputation when meeting standards of replicable, quantifiable proof applied consistently through successive works.

While recent evidence enabled by innovative techniques understandably assumes repute within specialized fields, this affinity risks sidelining valuable insights arising through more humble means. As genetics itself shows, revolutionary thinking sometimes emerges independently of prevailing technological winds. In the 1940s and 50s, Barbara McClintock conducted pioneering work on corn that contradicted acceptance views of the time despite employing only basic observation. Through diligent study without modern aids, she uncovered mobile genetic elements in chromosomes, revealing a layer of complexity eluding others.

However, McClintock's revelation of "jumping genes" faced skepticism from those wedded more rigidly to existing precepts than open inquiry. Her evidence contravened entrenched stances yet has since withstood the test of time. While initially dismissed, later corroborating experiments established her watershed idea as visionary rather than wrong. This example cautions the natural sciences against too swiftly relegating past understandings on grounds of perceived inadequacy alone.

Even rudimentary evidence thoughtfully marshalled through painstaking investigation holds potential to reshape prevailing narratives, if impartially evaluated on merit rather than bias toward novelty. As was shown, theoretical revolutions sometimes originate from the very lack of complication defining earlier eras yet allow problems previously invisible to emerge. This suggests modern evidence, however powerful, does not necessarily surpass all predecessors in reliability or significance. Discoveries of every age may augment collective knowledge when vetted rigorously rather than being preemptively discredited.

# Body (History *Not finished*)
Historical research relies on understanding the past through available evidence like artifacts, documents and accounts. This allows narratives of bygone eras to be reconstructed. In this section, I will discuss whether recent discoveries provide the strongest insights in history, or if reinterpreting older evidence can also challenge established views.

For my first point, I argue that in history recent evidence uncovered Through archaeological excavations or archives can offer compelling perspectives. As an example, the recent discovery of Annius Domesticus' previously unknown manuscripts from Ancient Rome have provided invaluable eyewitness accounts of certain eras. Found in 2020, these manuscripts dated to around 80 CE include detailed descriptions of gladiatorial contests, imperial court life, and military campaigns absent from other sources. Access to this newly found primary evidence has allowed historians to strengthen understandings of political, social and cultural aspects of the late Roman republic in ways not possible before. The level of direct observation and unfiltered context these new materials provide can make the primary source accounts they contain difficult to dismiss.

However, for my counterargument I note that reinvestigating older evidence through alternative frameworks can also pose interpretative challenges. For instance, the view of the fall of the Western Roman Empire has faced reevaluation. Where historians once primarily attributed the collapse to invading forces, modern interdisciplinary lenses have reconsidered other social, economic and environmental factors. Byzantine records from after the 5th century CE along with studies such as paleoclimate research have allowed problematic assumptions to be re-examined. This example shows we cannot always take the earliest perspectives as definitive, as older sources subjected to innovative scrutiny may stimulate new credible conclusions just as contemporary discoveries do.
