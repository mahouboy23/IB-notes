# knowers and knowing
Created: 2022-09-28

### **What is knowledge** 
There is a deep and strong connection between Knowledge and Knower. To establish the connection between knowledge and the knower, its is pragmatic to know that knowledge does not necessarily mean an outcome of critical thinking but it does involve seeking answers to questions. The answers often require evidence however sometimes we make judgements on the information without much effort of scrutinizing and dissecting it. We often believe information as Knowledge at its face value. Remember, that most knowledge is not contestable because it is certain. 

For the JTB model to hold, Knowledge must be :

?
1. **Justified:** 
The knowledge claim is justified with adequate evidence. Justification requires coherence with previous data and Clarity with regard to language and logic. There can be no contradiction or strong counter evidence.
3.  **True:** 
The knowledge claim is true rather than false. It corresponds to the real world. It is a fact. It is "what is the case".
4.  **Believed:** 
The knowledge claim is matter of Conviction. We must own out Knowledge.
