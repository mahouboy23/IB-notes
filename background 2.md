Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main sets: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms deal with problems where a data set is provided and the correct output is known. Within supervised learning, there are two main groups of algorithms: classification algorithms and regression algorithms.

Classification algorithms are used to group given sets of data into defined classifications by examining the data to detect similarities that will be used in grouping the data. Examples of classification algorithms include decision trees, Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, and Logistic regression algorithm.

Regression algorithms, on the other hand, are used to predict results within a continuous output by establishing a relationship between input variables and a continuous function. An example of a regression algorithm is using the relationship between the land area of houses and their corresponding prices to predict the price of a house based on its land area.

In the context of the extended essay, the focus is on comparing the performance of the Linear Regression algorithm and Logistic Regression algorithm in recognizing medical conditions based on their symptoms. Both algorithms fall under the supervised learning category and are used for classification problems.

The Linear Regression algorithm can predict the severity of a medical condition based on its symptoms, while the Logistic Regression algorithm can predict the presence or absence of a medical condition based on its symptoms. Both algorithms have been widely used in medical data recognition due to their simplicity, interpretability, and high accuracy.Overall, the focus of this investigation is to compare the accuracy and performance of these two classification algorithms in recognizing medical conditions based on their symptoms.
