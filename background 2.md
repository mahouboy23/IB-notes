Machine learning algorithms are designed to learn patterns and relationships within datasets, and can be divided into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms are used for problems where a dataset with correct outputs is available, and are further categorized into two groups: classification algorithms and regression algorithms.

Classification algorithms are used to classify data into predefined categories based on their characteristics. These algorithms analyze the data to identify similarities and patterns that will be used to group them. Decision trees, Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, and Logistic regression algorithm are common examples of classification algorithms.

Regression algorithms, on the other hand, are used to predict the continuous output values based on input variables. They establish a relationship between the input variables and a continuous function to predict the output. For instance, using the relationship between the area of a house and its price to predict the price of a new house is a regression problem.

Both classification and regression algorithms are widely used in different applications, including medical data recognition. For instance, the Logistic regression algorithm is used to predict the presence or absence of a medical condition based on the patient's symptoms, while Linear regression algorithm can predict the severity of a medical condition based on its symptoms.

In summary, machine learning algorithms are used to learn patterns and relationships within datasets, and are categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms include classification and regression algorithms, which are used to classify data into predefined categories or predict continuous output values based on input variables.
