"AN INVESTIGATION OF THE HEIGHT OF AN INCLINED PLANE ON THE MOMENT OF INERTIA OF A SEALED OIL DRUM"
Research Question: How does the height of an inclined plane affect the moment of inertia of a sealed oil drum?

I. Introduction

Oil accounts for 3% of the global economy's gross domestic product and has become the lifeblood of industrialized nations. Today, it functions as one of the world's most important commodities in producing electricity and propelling vehicles. Because of my family's involvement in the oil industries, I have constantly been exposed to the nature of its handling and transportation, which has indirectly, motivated me to pursue an investigation in this field. An essential component of being able to satisfy the oil demands of a multitude of nations is the logistics of unloading methods that ensure no physical damage is caused to the drum's exterior and that its heavy contents do not leak or spill as this could both compromise environmental ecosystems and interact with flammable material, leading to aggressive reactions.
What struck me about this seemingly overlooked component is the ability of these drums to exhibit opposition to a change in their rotational speeds or what is known as their moment of inertia; as such, the oil drum with greater linear velocity would translate to higher angular velocity and lower moment of inertia, vice versa. Connecting this, I acknowledge that previous experimentations have frequently dealt with solid or hollow objects, hence, exploring this topic with a fluid-filled cylinder amplified my curiosity for investigation. Within my physics classes, I learned that, without resistive forces, increased gravitational potential energy would yield an increase in kinetic energy owing to the conservation of mechanical energy; as such, I would like to explore this relationship with the consideration of an object that integrates rotational kinetic energy. Therefore, I decided to simulate the unloading method of an oil drum by varying the ramp's height in ultimately detecting a relationship with its moment of inertia.


II. Background Information

**Rotational Kinetic Energy**
The rotational kinetic energy occurs owing to a body's rotation and is a component of the entirety of its kinetic energy. This variable is directly proportional to both the object's moment of inertia and the square of its angular velocity. This is expressed by the formula:
K = rot
= 1/21w2
wherein: Krot = rotational kinetic energy (J), I = moment of inertia (kgm2), w = angular velocity (rads-1)

a. Moment of Inertia
This refers to the scalar, quantitative measure of the opposition exhibited by an object in response to changes in rotational speeds linked to the application of torque (turning force). This variable is significant because of its connection to Newton's first law of motion which tackles the concept of inertia; it is able to describe an object's stability and the forces required to alter its motion and kickstart angular acceleration. Jones (2019) states that moment of inertia I is determined with a focus on the


**Theoretical and Experimental Linear Velocity**
Murray (2013) determined the final velocity of a cylinder rolling down an inclined plane by utilizing the torque and parallel axis theorem and verifying his results under the conservation of energy. He deduced the formula as follows:
v = 1 √gdsino = √gh
wherein: v = final velocity (ms1), g = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 ms), d = rolling distance (m), = angle of incline, h = height of incline (m)
On the other hand, the experimentation would be utilizing a Vernier photogate to measure the linear velocity of the oil drum rolling down the plane while utilizing the theoretical approach of this variable for data confirmation and comparison.


**Gravitational Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy**
Gravitational potential energy refers to the energy of an object due to its position within a gravitational field, whereas, kinetic energy refers to the energy of an object due to its motion.
