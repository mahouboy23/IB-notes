DIP (data information processing)
 Data is not used Alone ---> need to be structure to be processed

cloud - 

simple data vs complex data
simple : - singular - raw/untreated/processed - can't be divided into smaller data
complex : 

## Declaration :
} dim x as var;
  dim y as var
  begin
  x - 12 (42)
  y - 24
  end
## Processing
while x > y
    do
x + y = True
Else
x + y = False

## Execute
x + y - False
x + y = 66

# DATA AND MEMORY
Mirror data Access
3 beeps = ram issues
5 beeps = cmos memory

## PDS REPRESENTATION
for the characters count the number of characters
![[PDS EXAMPLE DUNIS]]

## Data types
### **declaration**
	dim Dunis as char
	dim x as interger

### declaration ex 1:
	dim logistics(2) as char
	dim APS(4) as float
	dim Location(3) as string
	dim nfaculty as integer
	dim nstudents as integer
