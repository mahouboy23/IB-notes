## Part 1
1. List as many features as you can that distinguish beings from other animals. 

Our self awareness, our mannerism, The way we think and do things, our sense of reason.

2. Compare your list with a partner. Can you agree on those features? why? why not? 

------------------------------------------------------- 
yes mostly but not completely

3. As a class, discuss: What are the difficulties with defining the "unique" features of various animals and humans? How far can we know that particular human characteristics are distinctive or unique? 



4. Do you need to do some research into this topic to be able to finalise your list? if so complete your list once you have found out what is known about the similarities and differences between humans and other animals. 
  
## Part 2
1. Think of examples of when your observations have been accurate and when they have let you down. When can we trust our observations?  



2. To what extent can we ever know how people behave and think when they are not being watched or observed
