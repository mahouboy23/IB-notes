## Natural Sciences questions

1. **What do we mean by "Natural world?"**
2. **What might fall outside the scope of "Natural world"** 

##  Introduction

*What is science* :: Science is both a body of knowledge and process of discovery. It explores the natural world from subatomic particules through the galaxies that make our universe, and everything that falls in-between.

The natural sciences explore and try's to understand the natura world around us in essence, this is the physical world and the forces acting upon it. Under the umbrella of the natural sciences come the life sciences, which are the branches of biology, and the physical sciences, which include disciplines such as chemistry, physics and the earth sciences.

#### Activity: Real life situation 
Think about the general steps involved when you do an experiment in sciences. To what extent might those steps change depending on the experiment you are conducting?

## The scientific method

Scientifique knowledge is based on observation and experimentation, along with the formulation of **hypotheses**. This has led to remarquable progress in our understanding of the world, because it involves analyzing evidence and drawing conclusions. Sometimes, these conclusion helped to from the basis of new theories that may even go against main stream believes and doctrines of the time. Sometimes scientist, however, will devise new theories before they have clear evidence for them and then design experiments to test the theories

#### Key words
- **Empirical** :: based on and verified by observation and experience

- **Polymath** :: a person with expertise in several field of knowledge

- **Hypotheses** :: a provisional explanation based on limited evidence that provides a starting point for further investigation
<!--SR:!2023-10-07,30,210-->
- **Scientific methods** :: a method of procedure for the way scientifique investigation's are conducted

We often refer to the scientific method as if were a single way of correctly doing sciences or acquiring reliable knowledge, there is no set of fixed steps that scientist always follows. Instead, there are many different ways of doing science. What they share is an empirical approach that involves lots of practices including : 
?
- asking question or defining problems
- planning and cutting out investigation 
- designing and creating models
- and analyzing and interpreting data 
- looking for patterns 
- building possible explanation 
- making generalization
- assessing results and theories 
- communicating results

## Methods

### -Observation
Our observation are linked to our senses. Our brain interprets and makes sense of the data it receives through or via or true sight, sound, taste, touch, smell and our other senses. There are important question here to evaluate, regarding the reliability of our senses and the scope and accuracy of our observation. 

### -The observer affect 
In human and natural sciences, there are a number of facteurs that affects us when we are making observation. The act of observing a phenomenon it changes the phenomenon being observed. People we
