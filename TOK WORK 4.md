1. **In your IB science classes, are you doing any real sciences?**

No we are doing theoretical sciences where we see the theoretical aspect and do hypothesis and theories

2. **Jot down in order the various subheadings you have actually used when writing up a lab report. To what extent does this align with what you already know about the scientific method?**

We pose an hypothesis where were gonna prove or contest the claim. Then do the experiment and test's after we extract and layout the data and then we analyse the data we the interpret and finally we take out a conclusion 

3. **Provide a real-life example of a lav you have actually done for each of the following criteria**: 
  a/  It was an experiment in biology where we tried to visualize and find the different parts of a cell.
  b/  
  c/ I tried to predict using machine learning what the results of a football match would be.
