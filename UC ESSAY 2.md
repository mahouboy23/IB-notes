description:
I was part of the sustainable development club at our school where we debated about sustainable development issues and organized projects, task and other for example we were sustaining a micro garden that was also used for the canteen and was sustained by members of that club. For the first i was tasked with a project for trying to raise awareness about global warming and such and show how are school and the development club talk the issue and put in charge of a Groupe that was supposed to handle it and as the oldest in the group and from a higher class i was supposed to set the example and lead the group of the younger. WE did threw multiple means presentation in each class, built a cite to show our achievement. The biggest hurdle was to organize the members and also get them interested and engaged i also had to set the example. But we managed to divide the roles and organise the more outgoing students to help present and the more reserved students helped behind and i managed to make each of them shine there qualities.

- **Experience: Leading a Sustainable Development Awareness Project**

**Problems Solved:** As a member of the Sustainable Development Club, I spearheaded a project aimed at raising awareness about global warming and sustainable practices within our school community. The challenge was not only to convey the urgency of these issues but also to mobilize and engage the members effectively.

**Lessons Learned/Skills Gained:** Leading this project taught me crucial leadership skills. I learned how to inspire and motivate a diverse group of students, delegate tasks according to strengths, and create an inclusive environment where everyone could contribute effectively.

**Impact Had:** Our project had a significant impact on our school community. Through presentations in each class and the development of an informative website, we effectively communicated the importance of sustainable development. More importantly, the project fostered a sense of ownership among club members and highlighted their strengths, empowering them to actively participate.

**How I Applied What I Learned:** Utilizing my leadership skills, I organized and guided a team of younger students within the club. By setting a positive example and delegating tasks based on individual strengths, I motivated and engaged each member. The more reserved students found their niche behind the scenes, while the outgoing ones excelled in presentations.

**Values, Skills, and Qualities Brought to UC:** This experience honed my leadership abilities, emphasizing empathy, delegation, and fostering a collaborative environment. It showcased my commitment to sustainability and my ability to inspire and guide others toward a common goal. It also highlighted my adaptability and effective communication in leading a diverse team.

**Connecting Actions to Insights Regarding Leadership:** Leading the Sustainable Development Awareness Project emphasized the importance of inclusivity and teamwork in achieving a shared vision. It reinforced my belief in harnessing individual strengths to create a cohesive and productive team. This experience underscored the significance of leading by example and encouraging others to shine based on their unique qualities.
