how the algorithm works:

1.  First, the algorithm takes in a set of input variables (also called independent variables or features) and their corresponding output variables (also called dependent variables or targets). For example, in the context of medical data recognition, the input variables could be the symptoms of a patient, and the output variable could be the severity of the medical condition.
 
2.  The algorithm then tries to find the best-fit line that represents the relationship between the input variables and the output variable. This line is represented by an equation in the form of $Y = mX + b$, where Y is the predicted output, X is the input variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept.

3.  To find the best-fit line, the algorithm calculates the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. The goal is to minimize this error by adjusting the values of m and b. This process is known as optimization.

4.  Once the algorithm finds the best-fit line, it can use it to make predictions for new input values. For example, if a new patient comes in with a set of symptoms, the algorithm can use the best-fit line to predict the severity of their medical condition.
