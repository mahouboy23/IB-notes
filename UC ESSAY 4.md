Write a response to the personal insight question (PIQ). There will be a description on the challenges and how it has been overcame. There will be info about myself the essay and other that will help you write the essay and give you context. Most importantly FOLLOW THE PROPERTIES!!! The properties are guide lines and rules that you need to follow or respect and should be top priority.

**Personal insight question** :   
Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.

description:
I expresses my creativity trough blender trying to represent mundane and simple object, because i find beaty in simplicity and try to recorded the moment of every day light. I don't quite remember why i got into blender i think it was simply by curiosity or chance but it helps me express a creative but simple feeling.

**How to write an essay for UC Prompt 2:** 

For Prompt #2 I recommend the Uncommon Connections Exercise:

1. Choose a topic. (Obviously.)
    
2. Imagine what someone else writing an essay on this same topic might write about—in particular, what values might that person emphasize? (Example: For violin, someone else might emphasize “discipline, hard work, and perseverance.” But that’s what a lot of others would focus on.) In short, I’m asking you to brainstorm the cliche version of an essay on this topic so that you can avoid writing it. To give you some ideas of what values others might write about,
    
3. Once you’ve brainstormed some usual (read: common or obvious) values, vow to NOT discuss only these values in your essay. Why? You’re more likely to blend in.  
      
    Dare to stand out! How? Like this:
    
4. Choose several uncommon values. (Example: For violin, you might select “privacy,” “practicality,” or even “healthy boundaries” in one of the blanks and then discuss how violin has helped you develop all three of these instead.)
    

Here’s a good general rule: **A boring essay** discusses a common topic and makes common connections using common language, while **a stand-out essay** discusses an uncommon topic, makes uncommon connections, and uses uncommon language.

IMPORTANT: I know what you’re probably thinking. “I don’t have an uncommon topic!” Or, “I’m not a writer!” Either is okay. Really. You can write a great essay still. How? Use your brilliant, infinite brain to make several uncommon connections. In fact, the more common your topic, the more uncommon your connections will need to be.

Here’s an essay that demonstrates lots of variety:

**UC Prompt 2 example essay: Drumming**

> Some time during middle school, I began my journey to establish a rock band, become its drummer and, most importantly, grow magnificent long hair. I enrolled at a local music institute for drum classes twice a week. I didn’t have a drum-kit at home, so I’d eagerly wait for those two one-hour sessions of smashing cymbals and double-kicking bases every week. I was having a great time, but some part of me always felt that I was not exploring my musical creativity as much as I could. 
> 
> Over the next few months, as I continued to develop my mastery of the drum-kit, percussion became a part of my everyday life and soon I could sense rhythmic patterns in ordinary sounds. When no drums were available, I’d start finger-tapping in synchronous rhythms on any rigid surface and, before long, finger-tapping became an integral part of my rhythmic intelligence.
> 
> Unlike drumming, finger-tapping allowed me to incorporate melody into standard grooves by tapping on surfaces that had varying degrees of hollowness. Since it was a percussion style that I instinctively developed by myself, finger-tapping gave me the artistic freedom to create something new.
> 
> But I didn’t want to shape my spontaneous finger-tapping artistry to master another percussion instrument like the Tabla or Maschine.
> 
> Therefore, I decided to invent my own instrument. Equipped with my expertise in robotics and coding, I used electronic items like piezoelectric sensors, pcbs, and transistors to build an instrument that reflected my own finger-tapping habits and patterns. It had ten small pads for my fingers and two large pads for my palms. I chose a raspberry-pi as its CPU and programmed it to play all kinds of melodies and beats. In this way, I learned how to coordinate my different talents and skills to amplify my total creative output.
> 
> My friends and family suggested that I name and advertise my invention and maybe sell it to a company. But if I did that, I would lose the essence of why I built it. I built it not to master its musical capacity but to develop my own musical creativity.

**Some things I love about this PIQ:** 

- The author begins the PIQ with a brief hook that shows his sense of humor. But—these two things are important—the **hook is very short** and **the topic** (drumming) **is made very clear**.
    
- At the end of paragraph 1, he notes, “but some part of me always felt that I was not exploring my musical creativity as much as I could.” Here, **he raises a question for the reader**: What will he do to more fully express his musical creativity? This is the challenge he’ll work to resolve over the rest of the PIQ. 
    
- In paragraph 2, the author **describes the first thing he did to resolve this challenge**: play drums in everyday life. Note that this paragraph was directly inspired by brainstorming from the first column of his BEABIES Exercise.
    
- In paragraph 3, the author **helps us understand what he learned by connecting to a value**: artistic freedom.
    
- In paragraph 5, the author **describes the second thing he did to resolve his challenge**: He decided to invent his own instrument. He also uses some “geeky language” (i.e., “piezoelectric sensors, pcbs, and transistors”) to show us that he knows his stuff when it comes to electronics. If you’re comfortable with jargon related to your topic, feel free to include a little in your PIQ. (Not too much, though, as you might distance your reader. A little, like this author uses, is great.)
    
- He ends paragraph 5 by clarifying what he learned and **why this was important to him:** “In this way, I learned how to coordinate my different talents and skills to amplify my total creative output.”
    
- He concludes the PIQ by describing why he chose _not_ to sell what he created; instead, **he emphasizes one of his core values**: “I built it not to master its musical capacity but to develop my own musical creativity.” This is fitting, given the prompt.
- I was 13 years old

properties:
- It **HAS** to be between 250-350 words preferably around 300 words.
- Use simple to understand language but express yourself clearly and expressively
- DON'T DO A CONCLUSION follow the structure
- develop what i learned from those experiences
-  **a stand-out essay** discusses an uncommon topic, makes uncommon connections, and uses uncommon language.
