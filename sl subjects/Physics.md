I want to prepare full commentary on a extract of (find and choose the most interesting and pertinent extract with a lot of meaning and then state it with the exact page/chapter number put it in quotes) holes by Louis Sachar with details and everything that can last about 8 minutes but then i want you to give a bullet version of the commentary and that what I'm gonna use to present, give me most of the important info and themes and i will fill in the gaps during the 10 m presentation here is the structure of the work:
