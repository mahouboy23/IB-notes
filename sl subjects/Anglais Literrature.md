## Summary of House Boy 

Toundi Ondoua, the rural African protagonist of Houseboy, encounters a world of prisms that cast beautiful but unobtainable glimmers, especially for black youth in colonial Cameroon. Houseboy, written in the form of Toundi's captivating diary and translated from the original French, discloses his awe of the white world and a web of unpredictable experiences. Early on, he escapes his father's angry blows by seeking asylum with his benefactor father Gilbert, the local European priest. He asks the amused by seeking asylum with his benefactor Father Gilbert, the Toundi's father disagrees with the practice, Father Gilbert accepts Toundi, He soon learns to read and write, and  becomes the houseboy, or servant of Father Gilbert.
Toundi accompanies him to Dangan and begins work at the Saint Peter Catholic Mission. While at the mission, Toundi observes the lives of both the native Africans and the writers who come to pray and pay their respects.
But later on, Father Gilbert meets an untimely death. Toundi then becomes "the Chief European's 'boy'--the dog of the Commandant."
When the commandants wife, Madame, arrived from Paris, she was conveyed by all men. She had an affair with the prison director, Mr. Moreau. Toundi found Himself stuck in the middle of that affair, being the messenger against his will. Others warn Toundi that he is involved in matters that will only end in harm for him, but he continues nonetheless. When the Commandant finds out that Madame is having an affair, all hell breaks loose at the Residence. At the end of the complicated events through the novel, Toundi is viewed as person standing in judgement by all sides of the affair. As a result, he is used as a scapegoat and blamed for crimes he has not committed. He is beaten badly, so much so that he dies after fleeing to Spanish's Guinea. Toundi's attempt to fulfils a dream of advancement and improvement opens his eyes to troubling realities. Gradually, preconceptions of the Europeans come crashing down on him as he struggles with his identity, his place in society, and the changing culture.
It is explained in the prologue that Toundi dies so the reader already knows. The narrative is therefore an unraveling, meant to show exactly how this once carefree individual ended up on his deathbed, in a country not his own, and with a sobering story that deserves to be told as a cautionary tale against the abuse of power and the effects of racism.

synopsis: 
"Lord of the Flies" is a novel by William Golding that explores the dark side of human nature. **The story follows a group of British schoolboys who become stranded on an uninhabited island after a plane crash. The boys must learn to survive on the island, but as time passes, they become increasingly savage and violent.**
The novel explores themes of power, control, and the struggle between civilization and savagery. As the boys struggle to maintain order and find a way to be rescued, they must confront their own inner demons and the brutal reality of survival in the wild.

Extract: 
An extract from "Lord of the Flies" by William Golding, from Chapter 8, page 143:
"Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart, and the fall through the air of a true, wise friend called Piggy."

Introduction: 
William Golding's novel "Lord of the Flies" explores the darkest aspects of human nature, as a group of young boys are stranded on a deserted island and must confront their own inner demons. The novel is a powerful allegory that speaks to universal themes of the loss of innocence and the corruption of humanity. The chosen extract, from chapter 12, comes at a crucial point in the novel, where the characters are forced to confront the reality of their situation. Ralph, the protagonist, weeps for "the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart, and the fall through the air of a true, wise friend called Piggy."

Body/Summary: 
The phrase "the end of innocence" encapsulates the central theme of the novel, which is the loss of innocence and the corruption of humanity when removed from societal constraints. This theme is prevalent throughout the novel, as the boys slowly shed their childlike innocence and succumb to their primal desires. The loss of innocence is symbolized by the boys' physical transformation - they become dirty and disheveled, their clothes become tattered, and they begin to resemble savage animals.

The phrase "the darkness of man's heart" emphasizes the theme that evil is inherent in human nature, waiting to be unleashed when the veneer of civilization is stripped away. This idea is a direct reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve and the fall of man. Golding uses this reference to suggest that evil is not just a societal construct, but an innate part of human nature. The novel argues that without the constraints of society, humans are capable of unspeakable acts of violence and cruelty. This is evident in the novel as the boys gradually become more violent and barbaric in their behavior.

Piggy's death serves as a symbol for the breakdown of society and the loss of rationality. Piggy was the voice of reason and represented the boys' only hope for restoring order, but his death signifies the complete triumph of savagery over civilization. The phrase "the fall through the air" is significant, as it not only describes the physical event of Piggy's death but also suggests a fall from grace and the loss of something pure and good.

It's important to note that "Lord of the Flies" is an allegory, which means that the novel is meant to be interpreted on a symbolic level. The island represents a microcosm of society, where the boys' actions reflect the behavior of adults in the real world. The themes of the novel are timeless and universal, as they explore the darker aspects of human nature that are still relevant today.

Golding's message in "Lord of the Flies" is a warning about the dangers of unchecked human nature and the importance of maintaining the institutions of society. The novel suggests that without the restraints of civilization, humans are capable of unspeakable acts of violence and cruelty. Golding argues that it's our responsibility as humans to recognize the darkness within us and actively work to suppress it in order to maintain a peaceful and civilized society.

Conclusion: 
The chosen extract from "Lord of the Flies" highlights the central themes of the loss of innocence and the darkness within human nature. The death of Piggy serves as a symbol of the descent into savagery and the tragedy of the loss of reason in the face of chaos. Golding's novel serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked human nature and the importance of maintaining the institutions of society, as well as a timeless allegory that speaks to the darker aspects of human nature. Ultimately, "Lord of the Flies" asks us to consider the importance of societal structures and the role they play in controlling the innate darkness within
