## Summary of House Boy 

Toundi Ondoua, the rural African protagonist of Houseboy, encounters a world of prisms that cast beautiful but unobtainable glimmers, especially for black youth in colonial Cameroon. Houseboy, written in the form of Toundi's captivating diary and translated from the original French, discloses his awe of the white world and a web of unpredictable experiences. Early on, he escapes his father's angry blows by seeking asylum with his benefactor father Gilbert, the local European priest. He asks the amused by seeking asylum with his benefactor Father Gilbert, the Toundi's father disagrees with the practice, Father Gilbert accepts Toundi, He soon learns to read and write, and  becomes the houseboy, or servant of Father Gilbert.
Toundi accompanies him to Dangan and begins work at the Saint Peter Catholic Mission. While at the mission, Toundi observes the lives of both the native Africans and the writers who come to pray and pay their respects.
But later on, Father Gilbert meets an untimely death. Toundi then becomes "the Chief European's 'boy'--the dog of the Commandant."
When the commandants wife, Madame, arrived from Paris, she was conveyed by all men. She had an affair with the prison director, Mr. Moreau. Toundi found Himself stuck in the middle of that affair, being the messenger against his will. Others warn Toundi that he is involved in matters that will only end in harm for him, but he continues nonetheless. When the Commandant finds out that Madame is having an affair, all hell breaks loose at the Residence. At the end of the complicated events through the novel, Toundi is viewed as person standing in judgement by all sides of the affair. As a result, he is used as a scapegoat and blamed for crimes he has not committed. He is beaten badly, so much so that he dies after fleeing to Spanish's Guinea. Toundi's attempt to fulfils a dream of advancement and improvement opens his eyes to troubling realities. Gradually, preconceptions of the Europeans come crashing down on him as he struggles with his identity, his place in society, and the changing culture.
It is explained in the prologue that Toundi dies so the reader already knows. The narrative is therefore an unraveling, meant to show exactly how this once carefree individual ended up on his deathbed, in a country not his own, and with a sobering story that deserves to be told as a cautionary tale against the abuse of power and the effects of racism.
