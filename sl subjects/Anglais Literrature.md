## Summary of House Boy 

Toundi Ondoua, the rural African protagonist of Houseboy, encounters a world of prisms that cast beautiful but unobtainable glimmers, especially for black youth in colonial Cameroon. Houseboy, written in the form of Toundi's captivating diary and translated from the original French, discloses his awe of the white world and a web of unpredictable experiences. Early on, he escapes his father's angry blows by seeking asylum with his benefactor father Gilbert, the local European priest. He asks the amused by seeking asylum with his benefactor Father Gilbert, the Toundi's father disagrees with the practice, Father Gilbert accepts Toundi, He soon learns to read and write, and  becomes the houseboy, or servant of Father Gilbert.
Toundi accompanies him to Dangan and begins work at the Saint Peter Catholic Mission. While at the mission, Toundi observes the lives of both the native Africans and the writers who come to pray and pay their respects.
But later on, Father Gilbert meets an untimely death. Toundi then becomes "the Chief European's 'boy'--the dog of the Commandant."
When the commandants wife, Madame, arrived from Paris, she was conveyed by all men. She had an affair with the prison director, Mr. Moreau. Toundi found Himself stuck in the middle of that affair, being the messenger against his will. Others warn Toundi that he is involved in matters that will only end in harm for him, but he continues nonetheless. When the Commandant finds out that Madame is having an affair, all hell breaks loose at the Residence. At the end of the complicated events through the novel, Toundi is viewed as person standing in judgement by all sides of the affair. As a result, he is used as a scapegoat and blamed for crimes he has not committed. He is beaten badly, so much so that he dies after fleeing to Spanish's Guinea. Toundi's attempt to fulfils a dream of advancement and improvement opens his eyes to troubling realities. Gradually, preconceptions of the Europeans come crashing down on him as he struggles with his identity, his place in society, and the changing culture.
It is explained in the prologue that Toundi dies so the reader already knows. The narrative is therefore an unraveling, meant to show exactly how this once carefree individual ended up on his deathbed, in a country not his own, and with a sobering story that deserves to be told as a cautionary tale against the abuse of power and the effects of racism.

info author: 
Louis Sachar is an American young-adult mystery-comedy author. He is best known for the Wayside School series and the novel Holes. Holes won the 1998 U.S. National Book Award for Young People's Literature and the 1999 Newbery Medal for the year's "most distinguished contribution to American literature for children".

possible extract: 
"Stanley watched Zero crawl back through his hole. It was a miracle he was still alive, but Stanley knew he would have to get him back to camp soon, even if he had to carry him. He crawled after him, and was just able to squeeze his body through the hole. He never would have fit when he first came to Camp Green Lake. He’d lost a lot of weight. As he pulled himself through, his leg struck something sharp and hard. It was a shovel. For a second Stanley wondered how it got there, but then remembered that Zero had taken it with him after striking Mr. Pendanski. It was cooler under the boat, which was half buried in the dirt. There were enough cracks and holes in the bottom of the boat, now the roof, to provide light and ventilation. He could see empty jars scattered about"

Intro:

-   The novel 'Holes' by Louis Sachar follows the story of Stanley Yelnats, a boy unjustly sent to a detention camp where boys are forced to dig holes everyday.
-   The extract (pg 105-106) shows the development of friendship between Stanley and Zero, a boy in the camp who is unable to read or write.
-   The extract highlights themes of friendship, freedom vs entrapment and kindness.

Body:

-   The extract begins with Zero helping Stanley dig his hole "before sunrise", showing Zero's immense kindness, caring nature and determination. Zero sacrifices his own time to help Stanley for no benefit of his own.

-   When Stanley tells Zero "You don't have to do this", Zero insists "I want to". This demonstrates Zero's resolute spirit and that he will not be deterred from helping Stanley. Zero then says "I'm digging for freedom", metaphorically reflecting how the unjust system of digging holes has trapped the boys. However, through friendship, they can attain a sense of freedom.

-   Zero's "lips formed a straight line of determination" reinforces how Zero is single-minded in his decision to help Stanley. Despite the challenges they face, Zero's determination and kindness shines through.

-   Stanley watches Zero dig for a while, gaining appreciation for Zero's kindness. Stanley thanks Zero, recognizing Zero as his first real friend in the camp. Their unlikely friendship shows how relationships can form between people of vastly different lives and temperaments.

-   Friendship: Zero's act of kindness helps Stanley realize Zero is his friend. Their friendship provides solace in the harsh camp environment.

-   Freedom vs Entrapment: The metaphor of "digging for freedom" shows their trapped situation in the camp. But they find freedom through friendship - highlighting the power of relationships.

-   Kindness: Zero's immense kindness and selflessness is shown through him helping Stanley dig, even at his own expense. His kindness is a shining light in the darkness of the camp.

Conclusion:

-   The extract highlights themes of friendship and freedom vs entrapment in the novel.
-   Through Zero's kind act of helping Stanley dig his hole and insisting on supporting him, an unlikely friendship develops between the two boys.
