**Object 1:** The book "The Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin

My first object for this TOK exhibition is The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, first published in 1859. This book represents the acquisition and spread of knowledge. In his book, Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. At the time, the prevailing belief was that species were unchanging, but Darwin's observations of animals during his voyage on the HMS Beagle led him to propose that populations of animals and plants adapt to their environment over generations through a process of natural selection.
I chose this book because Darwin's theory of evolution has become the foundation of modern biology. The knowledge outlined in The Origin of Species has fundamentally changed our understanding of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. When first published, Darwin's ideas were controversial and went against religious doctrine. However, as evidence accumulated to support evolution, it became widely accepted by the scientific community and the general public. This is an example of how the spread of new knowledge, even if initially controversial, can lead to progress.


**Object 2**: Confidential documents "INSERT CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT"

My second object is a confidential government document. Confidential documents represent restricted knowledge that is intentionally kept hidden from public view. Not knowing the contents of confidential information can lead to speculation, distrust in authority, and spread of misinformation.
I chose a confidential government document as an example of how restricting access to knowledge can have societal costs. Governments often classify information over concerns of national security, but this secrecy can breed distrust and conspiracy theories. For example, the lack of transparency over CIA "enhanced interrogation techniques" after 9/11 led to widespread international criticism when they were eventually leaked. However, some government secrecy is necessary to protect ongoing operations and agents in the field.
There is an ongoing debate around government overreach in restricting information versus the public's right to know. Laws aim to find a balance, for example by limiting the government's power to classify information and requiring eventual declassification of historic records. However, striking the right balance is complex with valid arguments on both sides. They highlight the need to limit unnecessary restrictions on information where possible to promote an open democratic process.

**OBject 3:** Map of Senegal, Carte de l'Afrique Françoise

My third object is a map of Senegal, located in West Africa. Maps represent knowledge, and this map specifically represents knowledge about the geography of Senegal that has been accumulated by cartographers and explorers over centuries of travel within Senegal. Access to maps has expanded our understanding of the world and enabled both mobility and control over space.
I chose a map of Senegal to demonstrate how knowledge acquisition can be linked to both progress and conflict. Maps were crucial in enabling European powers to explore Africa during the Age of Discovery and eventually colonize Senegal. The French gained control over the territory in the 17th century. While maps represented knowledge, they were also tools for exploiting and controlling local populations. The borders of modern Senegal were defined by colonial rulers, at times disregarding cultural boundaries of local ethnic groups like the Wolof people.
Today, maps remain essential for development, enabling mobility, resource extraction, and connectivity that power Senegal's economy. However, they also represent the historical legacy of outside control over the Senegalese people and their land.
