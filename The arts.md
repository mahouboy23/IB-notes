3- 'Every work of art is the child of its age and, in many cases, the mother of our emotions, it follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated.' **Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944)**


From our understanding we can dissect the quote into three parts and analyse them. We can interpret the first part "Every work of art si the child of its age" by saying that it the identity and definition of art is heavily reliant on its time period or to be more precise the art mouvement because the different styles and themes of are depicted by it's mouvement. We can give the exemple of the mouvement of realism which created a new wave of realist artist. The meaning of the second part  could imply that art has the capabilities to move the masses to create predominant emotion and feelings and bring people and cultures together for a singular cause. And from our understanding the last part 'it follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated.' is trying to tell us that each period of time, each mouvement had its own unique way of making, expressing and interpreting art cannot be completely replicate.


For each quotation, consider:
1. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation ? 


2. What do you think the quotation suggests about the nature and purpose of the art is refers to?

**It tells us that art provide different type of emotions and in a different period of time it transfer to us different type of unique ideas depending on the historical context**

3. Can you identify any implicit or explicit assumptions that the speaker makes about the arts?
**That art is depend on the period and mouvement. art could move masses and hearts. art of time period cannot be completely replicated because of the context**


4. Do you think the quotation could apply to other areas of knowledge? if so, in what ways?

**This quotation can applied in Art and History because it's mainly referring to art and how they provides emotions and how it gives their ideas during a different period of time**
