## The Origin of Race in the USA

### Early Definitions of Race
- **Kinship and Affiliation**
    - Early definition of race: category of kinship or group affiliation.
    - In the 16th century: race referred to being part of the same household or sharing a common ancestor.
    - Not associated with physical traits or behavior.
### The Shift in the 17th and 18th Century
- **Colonialism and Global Capitalism**
    - Driven by slavery and colonization.
    - Spanish enslaved Native populations in the Caribbean and Latin America for labor (gold/silver mining).
    - English settlers in Virginia (1607) attempted similar methods.
- **Transition to Enslaved Africans**
    - Native resistance (fighting, escaping, blending with other groups) limited success.
    - Labor needed for tobacco cultivation → reliance on enslaved Africans.
- **Indenture vs. Enslavement**
    - **Indenture**: Contractual labor with fixed terms.
        - Some arrived willingly, others as punishment or children.
        - Could lead to eventual property ownership.
    - **Enslavement**: Permanent, abusive system.
        - No contracts (slaves were not considered human).
        - Hereditary slavery: children born to slaves inherited enslaved status.
- **Pseudo-Science of Race**
    - Emerged to justify slavery.
    - Linked physical features to behavior and legal rights.

### The Enlightenment and Race
- **Impact of the Enlightenment**
    - Push for "reason" and scientific categorization.
    - Developed hierarchical systems to classify the natural world, including humans.
    - Used physical markers to justify social norms like slavery and genocide.
- **Examples of Enlightenment Thinkers**
    - **Thomas Jefferson**: Claimed enslaved Africans required less sleep to justify inhumane work hours.
    - **Samuel Cartwright**: Introduced "drapetomania" as a supposed mental defect causing slaves to run away.
    - Philosophers like Hegel and Kant excluded non-European groups from history and progress.
### Laws and Social Structures
- **Naturalization and Citizenship**
    - 1790 U.S. law: citizenship limited to “free white persons.”
    - Children of enslaved mothers inherited enslaved status.
- **Anti-Miscegenation Laws**
    - Prohibited intermarriage between races to maintain racial purity.
### The Evolution of Whiteness
- **Matthew Jacobson’s Insights**
    - Whiteness evolved as a racial group.
    - Initially exclusive to Anglo-Saxons; other Europeans categorized as separate races (e.g., “Celts,” “Slavs”).
    - By the 1920s, these groups were unified under "whiteness" to create a cultural majority.
### Modern Perspectives
- Increased emphasis on ethnic identity (pride in cultural origins).
- Persistent debate over biological determinism in race.
