- Light bulb: 24/7 factories, streetlights, nightlife
- Consumer goods: washing machines, vacuums, refrigerators
- Communication: telephone (Bell), wireless telegraphy (radio)
- Transportation: streetcars, subways, automobiles (urban expansion)
- Mass production: assembly lines, interchangeable parts
- Global marketplace: steamships, industrialized nations dominate
- Key figures: Henry Bessemer (steel), Thomas Edison (light bulb) but hold a dark secret
- Cities grow upward (skyscrapers), outward (suburbs)
- Dark side: poor working conditions, imperialism, Black inventors are hidden

- **Entrepreneur**: Youth-driven, fearless innovation (no legacy burdens), focus on future opportunities.

Dear Dr. Hanan,

I believe my participation in this course has been improving. While at the start I was less vocal, I actively engaged in class discussions as the course progressed, and contributed different ideas. I consistently attended classes, submitted assignments on time, and put effort into class work. However, I recognize I need to better my note-taking skills and review readings more seriously to better understand the course. Based on what i have accomplished, I feel a grade of 90/100 reflects my participation fairly. Thank you for your guidance.

Sincerely, Mahouna Djokpe
