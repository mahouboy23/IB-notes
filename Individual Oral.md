### Literary work extract
"We didn't always live on Mango Street. Before that, we lived on Loomis on the third floor, and before that, we lived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, and before that, I can't remember. But what I remember most is moving a lot. Each time it seemed there'd be one more of us. By the time we got to Mango Street, we were sixâ€”Mama, Papa, Carlos, Kiki, my sister Nenny, and me."
**"The House on Mango Street"**, By Margaret MacMillan
