Write a response to the personal insight question (PIQ). There will be a description on the challenges and how it has been overcame. There will be info about myself the essay and other that will help you write the essay and give you context. Most importantly FOLLOW THE PROPERTIES!!! The properties are guide lines and rules that you need to follow or respect and should be top priority.

**Personal insight question** :  Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.

description:
The subject that inspire is computer science i was really fond of that subject as like how we use simple and structured ways to solve complex solutions. And in researching for an assign i came accross a book

**UC Prompt 6 example essay: History**

> Through books like **_Man’s Search for Meaning_** by Viktor Frankl about his incarceration at Auschwitz and **documentaries like _Enemies of the People_** about the Khmer Rouge, history has taught me that human empathy knows no borders. 
> 
> My favorite “history nerd” moments occur when I can explain a modern socio-political phenomenon by drawing connections to a historical event, like tying the gender pay gap to the Neolithic Revolution and linking recent voting patterns to centuries of _de jure_/_de facto_ racism. For my **IB Extended Essay**, I am writing about the Second Amendment, and I hope to elucidate the current gun control debate with research surrounding the legacy of the Glorious Revolution. 
> 
> My passion for history led me to an **internship** at the Sejong Institute, a think-tank specializing in Korean diplomacy. While I translated Korean research publications on topics like denuclearizing North Korea and resolving the South China Sea disputes, I drew heavily from what I learned of the region’s past, coming to understand that international conflicts cannot be resolved in the absence of historical insight. 
> 
> This notion also applies to my participation in **Model UN**. Exploring the ramifications of historical events has helped me create more comprehensive solutions; learning about the often-controversial past actions of nations has prompted me to raise ethical questions. For instance, I was appalled to learn that the Kurdish crisis, Syrian Civil War, and ISIL could be traced to the Sykes-Picot agreement, which carved up the region into ‘spheres of influence’ in 1916. In resolving these conflicts, how do we balance national sovereignty with the responsibility of former colonial powers to stabilize the region?
> 
> This summer, I enrolled in “**Introduction to Sociocultural Anthropology**” at UC Irvine. From tracing the African exodus of _Homo erectus_ two million years ago to examining _La Bestia_ (Mexican freight trains used by US-bound migrants), I now understand that migration is as old as history itself. 
> 
> In college, I hope to continue drawing connections between history and contemporary geopolitics as a Political Science major. Eventually, I hope to become a civil rights attorney, and the first Asian woman on the Supreme Court.

**Some things I love about this PIQ:** 

- In paragraph 1, the **author clarifies the subject right away**: History. So the reader doesn’t have to guess/wonder what it is.
    
- The author then includes a **wide variety of ways she’s explored this subject**, both in and out of school. 
    
- She **includes one way per paragraph**, which provides a clear structure. I’ve bolded each way to make it easy to see. Note: The author did not bold these in her PIQ, and you don’t have to in yours. 
    
- The **end of almost every paragraph includes an insight**, which is an answer to the question “so what?” or “why is this important?”
