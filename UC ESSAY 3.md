Write a response to the personal insight question (PIQ). There will be a description on the challenges and how it has been overcame. There will be info about myself the essay and other that will help you write the essay and give you context. Most importantly FOLLOW THE PROPERTIES!!! The properties are guide lines and rules that you need to follow or respect and should be top priority.

**Personal insight question** :  Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.

description:
The subject that inspire is computer science i was really fond of that subject as like how we use simple and structured ways to solve complex solutions. And in researching for My IB Extended essay i came across a book By Michael Nielsen on neural networks and deep learning which peeked my interest for algorithms and how they function and as there is an ai revolution. This interest and in computer science and computer dates back way before when i joined a robotics club or when i interned at a solutions integration firm (sylversys).

- **UC Prompt 6 example essay: History**

> Through books like **_Man’s Search for Meaning_** by Viktor Frankl about his incarceration at Auschwitz and **documentaries like _Enemies of the People_** about the Khmer Rouge, history has taught me that human empathy knows no borders. 
> 
> My favorite “history nerd” moments occur when I can explain a modern socio-political phenomenon by drawing connections to a historical event, like tying the gender pay gap to the Neolithic Revolution and linking recent voting patterns to centuries of _de jure_/_de facto_ racism. For my **IB Extended Essay**, I am writing about the Second Amendment, and I hope to elucidate the current gun control debate with research surrounding the legacy of the Glorious Revolution. 
> 
> My passion for history led me to an **internship** at the Sejong Institute, a think-tank specializing in Korean diplomacy. While I translated Korean research publications on topics like denuclearizing North Korea and resolving the South China Sea disputes, I drew heavily from what I learned of the region’s past, coming to understand that international conflicts cannot be resolved in the absence of historical insight. 
> 
> This notion also applies to my participation in **Model UN**. Exploring the ramifications of historical events has helped me create more comprehensive solutions; learning about the often-controversial past actions of nations has prompted me to raise ethical questions. For instance, I was appalled to learn that the Kurdish crisis, Syrian Civil War, and ISIL could be traced to the Sykes-Picot agreement, which carved up the region into ‘spheres of influence’ in 1916. In resolving these conflicts, how do we balance national sovereignty with the responsibility of former colonial powers to stabilize the region?
> 
> This summer, I enrolled in “**Introduction to Sociocultural Anthropology**” at UC Irvine. From tracing the African exodus of _Homo erectus_ two million years ago to examining _La Bestia_ (Mexican freight trains used by US-bound migrants), I now understand that migration is as old as history itself. 
> 
> In college, I hope to continue drawing connections between history and contemporary geopolitics as a Political Science major. Eventually, I hope to become a civil rights attorney, and the first Asian woman on the Supreme Court.

**Some things I love about this PIQ:** 

- In paragraph 1, the **author clarifies the subject right away**: History. So the reader doesn’t have to guess/wonder what it is.
    
- The author then includes a **wide variety of ways she’s explored this subject**, both in and out of school. 
    
- She **includes one way per paragraph**, which provides a clear structure. I’ve bolded each way to make it easy to see. Note: The author did not bold these in her PIQ, and you don’t have to in yours. 
    
- The **end of almost every paragraph includes an insight**, which is an answer to the question “so what?” or “why is this important?”
- It was in Senegal
- I am from bénin

properties:
- **includes one way per paragraph**, which provides a clear structure.
- **end of almost every paragraph includes an insight**
- It **HAS** to be between 250-350 words preferably around 300 words.
- Use simple to understand language but express yourself clearly and expressively
- DON'T DO A CONCLUSION follow the structure

Answer :
Computer science has always fascinated me due to its structured approach to solving intricate problems. Delving deeper into this subject, I stumbled upon Michael Nielsen's book on neural networks and deep learning while researching for my IB Extended essay. This discovery further piqued my interest in algorithms and their functionalities, especially within the context of the ongoing AI revolution.
The allure of computer science isn't recent for me; it predates my involvement in the robotics club or my internship at Sylversys, a solutions integration firm. The club provided a hands-on experience, allowing me to witness the practical applications of theoretical concepts. Meanwhile, my internship at Sylversys offered invaluable insights into the real-world implementation of computer science principles.
Exploring computer science inside and outside the classroom has been crucial in shaping my understanding of its vast applications. It has not only broadened my theoretical knowledge but has also honed my problem-solving skills. The exposure to real-world projects like the micro garden sustainability initiative during my involvement in the robotics club instilled a practical aspect to my theoretical learning.
Moreover, my internship at Sylversys allowed me to witness firsthand the relationship between theoretical knowledge and its practical applications. This experience underscored the importance of adaptability and the need to evolve in the ever-changing landscape of technology constantly.
My journey in computer science has taught me the value of perseverance in understanding complex concepts and the significance of bridging the gap between theory and application. But this is only the start, this fascination with algorithms and their functionalities drives my curiosity, compelling me to explore further and contribute meaningfully to the evolving field of computer science.
Through these experiences, I've gleaned insights into the versatility of computer science, its real-world implications, and the necessity for continuous learning in an era where technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. This academic interest has inspired me and instilled in me a sense of determination to pursue a path that merges theory with practical innovation.
