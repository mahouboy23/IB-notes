frontend (using React), backend (using Node.js), and a database (MySQL). Here's an outline of how you might structure the project:

### Frontend (React):

#### Pages/Components:

### 1. **Login/Authentication Page:**

    - Redirect to the Dashboard upon successful login.
- **Structure:**
    - Form component for login fields.
    - Error handling for invalid credentials.
    - Integration with backend API for authentication.

### 2. **Dashboard:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Display overall statistics.
    - Navigation to different sections (Class Management, Teacher Interface, Student Interface, Coordinator Dashboard).
- **Structure:**
    - Cards or panels displaying statistics.
    - Sidebar/Navbar for navigation.
    - Dynamic content based on user role (teacher, student, coordinator).

### 3. **Class Management:**

- **Functionality:**
    - List of classes for 11th and 12th grade.
    - Access to specific class details.
- **Structure:**
    - Class list component displaying classes.
    - Clickable links to access individual class details.

### 4. **Teacher Interface:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Grade input form per student for various subjects.
    - Setting grade boundaries.
- **Structure:**
    - Forms for entering grades.
    - Settings section for grade boundaries per subject.

### 5. **Student Interface:**

- **Functionality:**
    - View grades in different formats (French, GPA, IB grading).
    - Download grade report as a PDF.
- **Structure:**
    - Tabs or options for different grading formats.
    - Download button for generating PDF report.

### 6. **Coordinator/Moderator Dashboard:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Access to all data.
    - User management (add/delete users), class management, data overview.
- **Structure:**
    - Admin panel with various sections (Users, Classes, Data Overview).
    - Tables or lists for managing users and classes.

### Additional Considerations:

- **State Management:**
    - Use React Context or Redux for managing application state (user authentication, data fetching, etc.).
- **Routing:**
    - Implement React Router for page navigation and URL handling.
- **API Integration:**
    - Utilize Axios or Fetch to communicate with backend APIs for CRUD operations.

### Component Breakdown:

- **Reusable Components:**
    - Header, Footer, Sidebar/Navbar for consistent layout.
    - Form components for login, grade input, etc.
    - Cards/panels for displaying statistics or class details.
    - Tables/lists for presenting data (user list, class list).

### Styling and UI/UX:

- **Design System:**
    - Maintain a consistent design system throughout the app.
    - Consider using a CSS preprocessor like SCSS for modular and maintainable styles.

### Testing and Validation:

- **Unit Testing:**
    - Write tests for components and functionalities.
    - Validate form inputs, API responses, and user interactions.

### Backend (Node.js):

#### Routes/Controllers:

### 1. **Authentication:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Verify user credentials (username/password).
    - Issue tokens upon successful login for subsequent API access.
- **Structure:**
    - Authentication middleware to validate tokens for protected routes.
    - Hashing passwords for secure storage.

### 2. **Class Management:**

- **Functionality:**
    - CRUD operations for classes (11th and 12th grade).
    - Retrieve class details, add/delete classes.
- **Structure:**
    - Routes handling GET, POST, DELETE operations for classes.
    - Controller functions for database interactions (fetching, updating, deleting classes).

### 3. **Teacher Interface:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Inputting grades for students.
    - Setting grade boundaries.
- **Structure:**
    - Routes for handling grade input and boundary settings.
    - Controllers to process grade input and boundary updates.

### 4. **Student Interface:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Accessing grades in different formats (French, GPA, IB grading).
    - Generating PDF reports.
- **Structure:**
    - Routes for retrieving grades in various formats.
    - Controller functions to format and provide grade data.

### 5. **Coordinator/Moderator Access:**

- **Functionality:**
    - Access to all data.
    - User management (add/delete users), class management, data overview.
- **Structure:**
    - Specific routes for admin functionalities.
    - Controllers to manage users, classes, and overview data.

### 6. **Database Operations (MySQL):**

- **Functionality:**
    - Connect Node.js to MySQL database.
    - Execute queries for CRUD operations.
- **Structure:**
    - Use MySQL Node.js drivers (e.g., `mysql2`) to handle connections.
    - Organize SQL queries into functions/methods for reusability.

### Security Measures:

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    - Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection or other attacks.
- **Authorization:**
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (teacher, coordinator, student).

### Error Handling and Logging:

- **Error Handling Middleware:**
    - Centralized error handling middleware for consistent error responses.
- **Logging:**
    - Implement logging mechanisms for tracking API requests, errors, and activities.

### Testing and Validation:

- **Unit Testing:**
    - Write tests for each route and controller function.
    - Validate responses, error handling, and database operations.

### Deployment and Scalability:

- **Deployment to Hosting Services:**
    - Deploy the Node.js app to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Use best practices to ensure the app can handle increased traffic and data volume.

### Database (MySQL):

#### Tables:

1. **Users**
    
    - Teacher, Coordinator details.
    - Authentication details.
2. **Classes**
    
    - Class details and related data.
3. **Grades**
    
    - Grade information tied to classes and students.
4. **GradeBoundaries**
    
    - Boundary settings per teacher and subject.

### Guide/Steps for Building:

1. **Setting Up the Database:**
    
    - Create tables using SQL queries for Users, Classes, Grades, etc.
2. **Backend Development (Node.js):**
    
    - Create API endpoints for different functionalities (authentication, class management, grading, etc.).
    - Implement database operations using MySQL queries.
3. **Frontend Development (React):**
    
    - Create components for different pages.
    - Connect frontend to backend using API calls.
4. **Integrating Authentication:**
    
    - Implement user authentication using tokens or sessions.
5. **Testing:**
    
    - Perform thorough testing of each functionality.
6. **Deployment:**
    
    - Host the backend on a server (like Heroku) and the frontend on a hosting service (like Netlify or Vercel).
