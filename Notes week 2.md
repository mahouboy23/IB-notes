## Discussion Notes
- Pangea is a supercontinent that existed about 300–200 million years ago.
- the Bering strait and the Strait of Gibraltar 

## The Origin of Race in the USA

### Early Definitions of Race
- **Kinship and Affiliation**
    - Early definition of race: category of kinship or group affiliation.
    - In the 16th century: race referred to being part of the same household or sharing a common ancestor.
    - Not associated with physical traits or behavior.
### The Shift in the 17th and 18th Century
- **Colonialism and Global Capitalism**
    - Driven by slavery and colonization.
    - Spanish enslaved Native populations in the Caribbean and Latin America for labor (gold/silver mining).
    - English settlers in Virginia (1607) attempted similar methods.
- **Transition to Enslaved Africans**
    - Labor needed for tobacco cultivation → reliance on enslaved Africans.
- **Indenture vs. Enslavement**
    - **Indenture**: Contractual labor with fixed terms.
        - Some arrived willingly, others as punishment or children.
        - Could lead to eventual property ownership.
    - **Enslavement**: Permanent, abusive system.
        - No contracts (slaves were not considered human).
        - Hereditary slavery: children born to slaves inherited enslaved status.
- **Pseudo-Science of Race**
    - Emerged to justify slavery.
    - Linked physical features to behavior and legal rights.
### The Enlightenment and Race
- **Impact of the Enlightenment**
    - Push for "reason" and scientific categorization.
    - Developed hierarchical systems to classify the natural world, including humans.
- **Examples of Enlightenment Thinkers**
    - **Thomas Jefferson**: Claimed enslaved Africans required less sleep to justify inhumane work hours.
    - **Samuel Cartwright**: Introduced "drapetomania" as a supposed mental defect causing slaves to run away.
### Laws and Social Structures
- **Naturalization and Citizenship**
    - 1790 U.S. law: citizenship limited to “free white persons.”
    - Children of enslaved mothers inherited enslaved status.
- **Anti-Miscegenation Laws**
    - Prohibited intermarriage between races to maintain racial purity.
### The Evolution of Whiteness
- **Matthew Jacobson’s Insights**
	- Whiteness emerged as a racial group.
	- Initially limited to Anglo-Saxons.
	- Other Europeans (Celts, Slavs) seen as separate races.
	- Unified as "whiteness" by 1920s to form majority.
### Modern Perspectives
- Increased emphasis on ethnic identity (pride in cultural origins).
- Persistent debate over biological determinism in race.

RACISM: NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE?
Is it justifiable to give preferential treatment to members of certain
social groups because they are members of the groups? Should certain
social groups be encouraged to preserve their identity and organize polit-
ically for the purpose of advancement in society? And should the state
allocate the resources at its disposal to benefit members of some social
groups because they are members of those groups? Some answer these
questions affirmatively, based on considerations of identity and past
abuses.l Others answer negatively, believing that affirmative answers
encourage the creation of a system that undermines democracy and the
values on which the American nation has been founded.2
The controversy has been framed in terms of gender (women), sexual
preference (gays), religion (Muslims), ethnicity (Hispanics), and class
(blue-collar workers), among others. But it is perhaps more stark in the
case of race. Racism against "Blacks" is frequently cited as a reason why
society needs to change not only the way "Blacks" are perceived by
members of other races, but also how "Blacks" perceive themselves. (I
place the names of races within quotes to indicate that I am using standard
terminology, but I should not be taken as endorsing it.) In order to fight
racism, "Blacks" need to develop positive attitudes toward themselves
and to fight for policies that benefit them. But this has been taken by some
as a kind of reverse racism that favors "Blacks" over other racial groups.
The argument is made that this is not essentially different from the racism
that has adversely affected "Blacks" in the past. To favor "Blacks" over
"Whites" is not different from favoring "Whites" over "Blacks." The
answer to negative racism—racism against certain races—is not a form of
positive racism—racism for certain the eradication of race as
a source of social identity, preferential treatment, and policy. A positive
kind of racism for certain races entails negative racism toward others;
racial pride and kinship become pernicious for those who are not members
of the race in question.

Although the controversy has been posed very often in these terms,
there is also another side to it which has been brought to light by those
who see themselves as victims of negative racism, This view is that
negative racism is a way of affirming positive racism.3 "Whites" are racist
against "Blacks" because they are positively racist toward themselves—a
negative form of racism toward one race is a way of establishing the su-
periority of another race and creating advantages for it.
Much of the rhetoric against preserving racial identity is based on the
view that a positive attitude toward one race entails a negative attitude
toward others and a negative attitude toward some races is a way of em-
phasizing a positive attitude toward others.4 For these reasons many argue
for a racially neutral society in which race ceases to be noticed. This con-
elusion finds further support in the claim that racism is based on
stereotypes that lack a credible foundation.
This controversy raises four fundamental questions: First, does it
make sense to talk about two forms of racism: negative and positive?
Second, does a positive form of racism toward one race imply a negative
form of racism toward another race? Third, does a negative form of racism
toward one race imply a positive form of racism toward another race? And
fourth, is all racism founded on groundless stereotypes? The challenge for
us here is to answer these four questions in a consistent and adequate way
that clarifies the logic of racism and its relation to stereotyping. I begin
with some comments about racism in general. Then I turn to the notions
of positive and negative racism and their interrelations. Finally, I raise
questions about the role of stereotyping in racism. My main theses are
two: First, positive and negative racisms do not imply each other,
although there are reasons why they can be thought to. Second, the fact
that negative racism tends to be founded on stereotyping, and stereotyp-
ing usually has no credible foundation, does not affect positive racism,
opening the door to what I call "racial pride" and "racial recognition."

I. Racism
The answers to the four questions we have posed are complicated not
only because the notions of negative and positive racisms are unclear, but
also because the very concept of racism is controversial and disputed.s A
common way of thinking about racism is as a view or set of beliefs about
the inequality of races, in which some are considered inferior to others.
Because this inequality or inferiority is frequently conceived biological-
ly,6 it has been argued that this position can be traced to the development
of a science of race and to modernity.' For some, however, racism is rather
a habit of perception that informs and controls the way some people see
some other people,8 and others focus on actions that affect adversely, or
discriminate against, those toward whom they are directed.9 Some add the
condition that racism includes an institutional system of power and in-
equality,10 so that those who lack power, even if they view or act
negatively toward members of a race, are not racist. 11 And others stipulate
the condition that for a view or an action to qualify as racist it needs to be
motivated by ideology. 12 Often these emphases are combined in various
ways among themselves and with others,13 presenting an almost chaotic
picture of racism and giving support to those who claim that racism is not
a unified phenomenon. 14 Indeed, recently some postmodernists have
adopted a position in which racism is considered to be "whatever it is
claimed to be in discourse," which means that anything anyone says about
racism is acceptable insofar as there is no way to determine whether any
view is better than any other.)' The only point on which there seems to be
wide agreement about racism is in its negative moral quality. 16
None of the views mentioned is adequate for our present purposes.
Some are too broad in that they include within racism many phenomena
that are clearly not so. Others are too narrow in that they leave out of the
category phenomena that clearly belong in it. And still others do not
conform to any ordinary understanding of racism or are inadequate for
any attempt at developing a systematic conception of it. Fortunately, it is
not necessary for us to settle the question of the appropriate understand-
ing of racism in order to address the issues that concern us here. For our
purposes, it suffices that we adopt a view of racism that is suffciently
broad to accommodate the parameters of the controversy we address
without prejudice. I propose the following:
Racism is an attitude toward individual members of a racial group or
toward the racial group as a whole, merely in virtue of the race, and a
racist is someone who has this attitude.
The conception of racism as an attitude is not universally accepted, but
the language employed by many of those who discuss racism leaves room for
it insofar as in their discourse they use terms such as hostility, contempt,
condescension, and prejudice, which can be interpreted as attitudes.17
Moreover, the broad conception proposed has advantages for the present
discussion in that it allows for a distinction between self-directed racism
and other-directed racism and between negative and positive racisms,
without ruling any of these out at the outset. It is for these reasons that I
adopt it, but note also that most of the arguments that follow do not
depend on this particular conception of racism, nor do I have space here
to justify it; my aim in adopting this view is primarily heuristic.
Other-directed racism is an attitude that people who consider them-
selves to belong to a particular race have concerning certain other people
that they regard as belonging to a different race precisely because they are
members of it. Self-directed racism is an attitude that people who consider
themselves to belong to a particular race have concerning themselves
precisely because they belong to the race. Negative racism consists of a
negative attitude toward a race or its members, whereas positive racism
consists of a positive one. Other-directed, self-directed, negative, and
positive racisms can be combined. An example of other-directed negative
racism is the attitude toward "Blacks" that was, and still is, common
among some "Whites" in the United States. It is negative because to be
identified as "Black" carries with it negative connotations and it is other-
directed because it is held by one group of people against another group.
An example of self-directed positive racism is the attitude toward
"Blacks" and being "Black" exemplified by the Black Power Movement
in the sixties. In this case, the emphasis was on "Black" identity and its
positive aspects. The aim was to develop pride on the part of "Blacks" in
being "Black" and in those attributes that were thought to be associated
with being "Black." Similar examples can be given of other-directed
positive racism and self-directed negative racism.
Now, our first concern here is rather with the question of whether it
makes sense to talk about two forms of racism: negative and positive.
And, if it makes sense, whether a positive form of racism toward one race
implies a negative form of racism toward any other race, and vice versa.
2. Positive and Negative Racisms
In ordinary discourse the term 'racist' is used to refer to groups,
societies, institutions, and cultures in addition to individual persons, and
it is often reserved for the negative phenomenon.18 A positive attitude
toward members of a racial group, or the racial group itself, held merely
in virtue of racial considerations, on the other hand, is often called racial
pride or kinship, when the attitude belongs to the members of the racial
group in question. 19 There is no name in general use for persons who have
this positive attitude with respect to members of racial groups, or to racial
groups considered as wholes, to which they do not belong, although there
are expressions of this sort for particular racial groups, usually pejorative
and used primarily by those who have a negative racist attitude toward the
group. This has been one of the reasons many object to the use of 'racism'
for any kind of positive racial attitude.20
Regardless of the position one takes in this controversy, the argument
can still be made that a positive attitude toward a race qua race entails a
negative attitude toward some other race, and vice versa. This means that
even what appears to be a positive attitude involves a negative one, and
what appears to be a negative attitude involves a positive one. The issue
that matters to us here, then, is not so much whether negative and positive
attitudes toward races, whether self-directed or other-directed, should be
regarded, or called, racism, but whether these attitudes are tied in such a
way that one implies the other. Put in logical terms, whether the notion of
"positive racism" entails the notion of "negative racism," and vice versa.
This is important because if they are so tied, then the benefits of a positive
attitude may be undermined and positive racism could, as some have
suggested, amount to a form of negative racism. And, since negative racism
is generally considered to be morally objectionable, then positive racism
likewise would have to be thought so. It is also important because the harm
of negative racism would open the door to benefits for the racist, making
its immorality even more perverse. For the moment I continue to use 'racism'
for both negative and positive attitudes to facilitate the discussion, but keep
in mind that we will come back to the issue of appropriate terminology later.
In principle, there are several ways in which negative and positive
racisms may be related, but four in particular appear pertinent for us:
I. Negative racism does not imply positive racism and positive
racism does not imply negative racism.
2. Negative racism implies positive racism, but positive racism does
not imply negative racism.
3. Negative racism does not imply positive racism, but positive
racism implies negative racism.
4. Negative racism implies positive racism and positive racism
implies negative racism.
These alternatives, as formulated, are still ambiguous to the extent that
they do not make clear whether the object of negative and positive racisms
is the same persons or race or different ones. Let's assume for the sake of
simplicity and economy that the target consists of different races. And let us
also assume, for the same reasons, that the subject of racism is the same, even
though in principle it could be different for negative and positive racisms.
Now, 1—4 are in fact complex propositions, each of which is
composed of two simple propositions, so their truth value depends on the
truth value of the simple propositions of which they are composed. Here
are the propositions involved:
A.
B.
C.
D.
Negative racism implies positive racism.
Positive racism implies negative racism.
Negative racism does not imply positive racism.
Positive racism does not imply negative racism.

Because the pair A and C, and the pair B and D, are contradictory, we
need only determine the truth value of one proposition in each pair in
order to establish the truth value of the four, and ultimately of 1—4. So I
propose to examine A and B, and show that they are both false, which
makes C and D true. This will indicate, in turn, that 2, 3, and 4 are also
false, but I is true. Let me take up B first:
Positive racism implies negative racism.
Does being positively racist toward members of a race imply also a
negative attitude toward the members of another race? Does having a
positive attitude toward "Blacks" imply a negative racial attitude toward,
say, "Whites'"? This does not seem to be necessary. That one likes blue
does not entail that one does not like red, even though red is one of those

colors that is not blue. That one appreciates the value of mercy does not
mean that one does not appreciate the value of temperance, even though
both are virtues and temperance is one of the virtues that is a member of
the class of things that are not mercy. The same seems applicable to race:
to have a positive attitude toward a particular race does not entail having
a negative attitude toward any other particular race. I can have a positive
attitude toward being "Black" and yet not have a negative attitude toward
being "White." This is very much like what happens with a family. I can
have a positive attitude toward my family, or members of my family, and
this does not entail that I have a negative attitude toward any other partic-
ular family or its members, or toward all families that are not my own or
their members. And the same seems to apply to individual persons. I can
have a favorable attitude toward Jane without having an unfavorable
attitude toward John or any other person that is not Jane.
Perhaps an example taken from another context might help us un-
derstand this matter further. Consider first the following proposition:
P l: Examination El merits the grade of A.
Now, PI implies the following three other propositions:
QI: There is an El.
Q2: There is a standard S for the grade of A.
Q3: El meets S for A.
Now consider a different proposition:
P2: An individual person IP judges that examination El merits the
grade of A.
The proposition P2 implies the following four other propositions:
QI:
Q2:
Q3:
There is an IP.
There is an El.
There is an S for A that IP uses to grade El.
Q4: IP judges that El meets S for A.
Several things seem to be clear from this example, which involves
the grading of examinations when an absolute standard, rather than a
curve, is used. First, Pl does not reflect an attitude of an individual person,
but a relation between an examination, a standard, and a grade. This
contrasts, second, with P2, which reflects a value judgment of an individ-
ual person IP Third, both Pl and P2 imply the existence of an
examination and a standard for the grade of A. And fourth, neither Pl nor
P2 imply anything about another examination (call it E2), its value, or a
judgment about its value. However, PI opens the possibility that were an
E2 to exist, it may or may not meet the standard for the grade of A, and
P2 opens the possibility that were an E2 to exist, an IP could judge that E2
meets or does not meet such standard.
If we apply this to race, it appears that the description ofa relation
between a race and a standard that turns out to be positive, implies nothing
negative about another race or its value. And a positive judgment about a
race meeting a certain standard seems to imply nothing about a judgment
concerning the negative value of another race. In short, positive racism does
not imply negative racism, just as positive value does not imply negative value,
and a judgment of positive value does not imply a judgment of negative value.
Now let me turn to A, the second proposition I need to examine:
