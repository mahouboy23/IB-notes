# Final Exam Revision Notes — Microeconomics

# 1. Production & Costs (Short Run)

## Relationship Between Production and Costs
- **Short run**: at least **one factor is fixed** (usually capital).
- As variable inputs (labour) increase → output changes according to the **law of diminishing returns**.

### Law of Diminishing Returns
- Adding more variable input to a fixed input eventually leads to **declining marginal product (MP)**.
- When MP falls → **MC (marginal cost) rises**.
- MP and MC are **inversely related**:
  $$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$  
  - When MP increases → MC decreases.  
  - When MP decreases → MC increases.

## Cost Curves (Short Run)

### Key Formulas
- **Total Cost (TC)** = FC + VC  
- **Average Cost (AC)**:  
  $$AC = \frac{TC}{Q}$$
- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**:  
  $$AVC = \frac{VC}{Q}$$
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**:  
  $$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$

### How To Identify Minimum Cost Output
- The **minimum AC** occurs where **MC = AC**.
- The **minimum AVC** occurs where **MC = AVC**.
- These points are the **lowest** points on each curve.

## Economies & Diseconomies of Scale (Long Run)
- **Long Run**: all factors of production are variable → cost curves change.

### Economies of Scale (AC falls)
- Better technology  
- Specialisation  
- Bulk buying  
- Spreading overheads  
- Financial economies  

### Diseconomies of Scale (AC rises)
- Poor communication  
- Coordination problems  
- Worker alienation

# 2. Profit Maximization

## Total Revenue & Total Cost Approach
- **Profit** = TR − TC  
- **TR** = P × Q  
- Profit is maximized where the **vertical distance between TR and TC is greatest**.

(("TR and TC profit maximization diagram"))

---

## Marginal Approach (MR = MC Rule)
- **Profit is maximized where:**  
  $$MR = MC$$
- If **MR > MC** → increase output.  
- If **MR < MC** → reduce output.  

### Shutdown Condition
- A firm continues to operate in the short run if:  
  $$P \ge AVC$$
- If **P < AVC**, firm shuts down.

---

## Determining Profit or Loss
Use:
$$\text{Profit} = (P - ATC) \times Q$$

### Cases:
- **Profit:** P > ATC  
- **Break-even:** P = ATC  
- **Loss but operate:** AVC ≤ P < ATC  
- **Shutdown:** P < AVC

## Long-Run Equilibrium & Efficiency
- Firms enter if profits exist → supply ↑ → P ↓  
- Firms exit if losses exist → supply ↓ → P ↑  
- Long-run equilibrium in perfect competition:
  $$P = MC = ATC$$  
  - **Productive efficiency:** P = minimum ATC  
  - **Allocative efficiency:** P = MC

# 3. Perfect Competition vs Monopoly

## Price, Output & Efficiency Comparison

### Perfect Competition
- Many firms, price takers  
- Output where **P = MC**  
- Lowest possible AC in long run  
- Allocatively efficient (P = MC)  
- Productively efficient (min ATC)  

### Monopoly
- Single seller, price maker  
- Output where **MR = MC**, price from demand curve  
- Price higher, output lower  
- Not allocatively efficient (P > MC)  
- Not productively efficient

# 4. Revenue Calculations

## Total Revenue (TR)
$$TR = P \times Q$$  

## Marginal Revenue (MR)
$$MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$$

## Profit from Tables
Steps:
1. Find TR for each Q.  
2. Find TC for each Q.  
3. Profit = TR – TC or (P – ATC) × Q  
4. Identify **maximum profit**.

---

## Determining MR = MC Output From Table
Steps:
1. Compute MR from changes in TR.  
2. Compute MC from changes in TC.  
3. Choose the Q where **MR = MC** (or closest).  
4. Use AR/price to find profit.

(("MR = MC table example diagram"))

# 5. Monopoly Topics

## Barriers to Entry
- Patents  
- Control of resources  
- Government licensing  
- Economies of scale (natural monopoly)  

These prevent firms from entering → monopoly can earn **long-run abnormal profits**.

# 6. Key Diagrams Needed for Exam
- Cost curves: AC, AVC, MC  
- Shutdown point  
- Profit areas (shaded)  
- TR–TC curves  
- MR–MC profit maximization  
- Perfect competition vs monopoly comparison  
- LRAC (economies & diseconomies of scale)

---

# 7. How To Draw Perfect Diagrams Quickly
- Label all axes  
- Use correct curve shapes  
- Identify equilibrium clearly  
- Shade profit/loss regions when needed  
- Write short notes under each graph  

---

# 8. Exam Strategy
- Start with easiest questions  
- For calculations: write formulas first  
- For diagrams: label everything  
- For short answers: 3–4 concise bullet points
