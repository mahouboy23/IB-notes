**What is Syllables and metric feet**: 
?
Every word in English consists of one or more syllables. A syllable is the unit of sound, when speaking a word, which usually has one vowel. Syllables provide the beats of the rythm of a poem. Some syllables are stressed, while others are naturally unstressed. When analysing poetry, you can look for the clusters and patterns of stresses in a line. Each unit of unstressed sound is known as metric foot.
