Personal knowledge is a knowledge we personally have. Almost all our personale knowledge is experiential. The exceptions would be any knowledge that is innate, that is, knowledge we are born with, or things that we can know a priori, it means, purely by reasons. An example of innate knowledge might be knowing how to breath, how to cry, knowing to search for our mothers nipple. 
Some people would say we are born with an innate sense of God.
